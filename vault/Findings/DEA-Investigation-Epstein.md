## Law Enforcement Assessment (Per CBS News Source)

- For DEA to open the case, a **drug nexus** must exist
- The OCDETF Fusion Center request indicates a **"significant" investigation** — not routine information inquiry
- Investigation ran for **five years or more** (opened 2010, document dated 2015)

---

## Caveats

- Names of 14 co-targets are **fully redacted** — identities unknown from public record
- Substantive investigative findings within the 69-page memo are heavily redacted
- No charges arising from this DEA investigation are documented in the public record
- Relationship between this investigation and the 2019 SDNY indictment is not established in source material
