# Donald Trump

> **Status: Active** — 45th and 47th President of the United States. Mentioned in released Epstein files. FBI 302 reports (withheld from initial DOJ release) contain explicit but unsubstantiated allegations that Trump sexually abused a woman when she was a minor in the early 1980s, allegedly with Epstein's assistance. **These allegations are #claim — unverified, contradicted by known facts about Epstein's life in the early 1980s, and the FBI never brought charges.** Trump has consistently denied wrongdoing. An administration official described the claims as "non-credible." Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act into law.

## Connection to Epstein

### FBI 302 Reports — Withheld Allegations (#claim)
- Three FBI Form 302 reports (25 pages of agents' notes) memorializing four interviews conducted in summer and fall of 2019 were **not included** in the DOJ's initial Epstein file releases beginning December 2025
- The Guardian obtained and reviewed the missing 302s; existence first reported by independent journalist [[People/Roger-Sollenberger]] and confirmed by NPR
- The 302s describe a woman who came forward after recognizing Epstein from a photo sent by a childhood friend
- Only the **first interview session** (in which she did not name Trump) was included in the public release
- The remaining three sessions contain explicit but unsubstantiated allegations that Trump sexually abused the woman when she was a minor in the early 1980s, allegedly with Epstein's assistance #claim
- Her allegations have **not been verified**; the FBI never brought charges related to her claims
- The Guardian noted her statements "at times appear outlandish" and "contradict what is known about Epstein's life in the early 1980s" #claim
- An administration official confirmed the three withheld 302s are authentic but described the allegations as "non-credible"
- The DoJ told NPR "nothing has been deleted" and that withheld material was "duplicative or privileged"
- Administration official to Guardian: "These non-credible accusations against President Trump made in 2019 were in the SDNY files and listed by reviewers as duplicative files, which are not legally required to be released by the Epstein [Files] Transparency Act as it was written by Congress."
- The allegations were also summarized in an internal FBI slideshow about the Epstein and Maxwell investigations, created in 2025, which was released
