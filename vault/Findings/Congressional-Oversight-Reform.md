# Congressional Investigations into the Epstein Enterprise and Priority Recommendations for Institutional Reform

---

## I. CONGRESSIONAL RECORD TO DATE

### Senate Judiciary Committee Activity

Congressional attention to the Epstein matter intensified following Jeffrey Epstein's arrest by the Southern District of New York on July 6, 2019, and his death in federal custody on August 10, 2019 [CONFIRMED] (United States v. Epstein, No. 19-cr-490, S.D.N.Y.). The Senate Judiciary Committee, then chaired by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), held a hearing on November 19, 2019, titled "Dereliction of Duty: Examining the Inspector General's Report on the Failures of the Federal Bureau of Prisons to Adequately Monitor and Protect Jeffrey Epstein" [CONFIRMED] (Senate Judiciary Committee, 2019). This hearing focused narrowly on the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) failures rather than the broader Epstein enterprise.

Key findings from this hearing included:

- **BOP staffing crisis**: The Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in Manhattan was severely understaffed, with correctional officers working mandatory overtime shifts and two guards assigned to Epstein's unit (9 South) both failing to conduct required checks on the night of his death [CONFIRMED] (DOJ Office of Inspector General, 2019).
- **Camera malfunction**: Surveillance cameras outside Epstein's cell produced unusable footage, a fact that fueled widespread public distrust [CONFIRMED] (DOJ OIG, 2019).
- **Limited subpoena action**: The committee did not subpoena DOJ leadership regarding the broader question of the 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) or the decision-making behind the original plea deal in Florida [CORROBORATED] (Levine, 2019).

Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) both pressed for further investigation into how Epstein was allowed to die in federal custody, but the committee did not convene follow-up hearings specifically on the Epstein enterprise's financial, recruitment, or co-conspirator networks during the 116th Congress [CORROBORATED] (Senate Judiciary Committee, 2019).

In the 117th Congress (2021–2023), under the chairmanship of Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), the committee's attention shifted to broader judicial reform and Supreme Court ethics. No dedicated Epstein hearings were held during this period, despite ongoing civil litigation in the Southern District of New York producing significant document disclosures from the Giuffre v. Maxwell case [CORROBORATED] (Brown, 2021).

The 118th Congress (2023–2025) saw renewed interest following the unsealing of additional Epstein-related documents by Judge Loretta Preska in the Southern District of New York in January 2024 [CONFIRMED] (Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 15-cv-7433, S.D.N.Y., unsealing order, Dec. 18, 2023). Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) publicly called for full disclosure of Epstein's associate list, though formal committee action was limited [CORROBORATED] (Broadwater, 2024).

### House Judiciary and Oversight Committee Activity

The House Judiciary Committee, under Representative Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) during the 116th Congress, conducted oversight of Attorney General William Barr's handling of Epstein's death and BOP conditions [CORROBORATED] (House Judiciary Committee, 2019). However, this oversight was largely consumed by the concurrent first impeachment inquiry of President Trump, limiting bandwidth for sustained Epstein investigation.

The House Committee on Oversight and Reform held no dedicated Epstein hearings during the 116th or 117th Congress [CORROBORATED]. Under Republican control in the 118th Congress (2023–2025), Chairman James Comer (R-KY) referenced Epstein in the context of broader investigations but did not convene standalone hearings on the Epstein enterprise.

The House Financial Services Committee, which has jurisdiction over banking regulation, held no hearings specifically examining JPMorgan Chase's or Deutsche Bank's relationships with Epstein, despite the landmark civil settlements in 2023 [CORROBORATED]. This represents a significant oversight gap, as the $365 million JPMorgan settlement (Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands v. JPMorgan Chase, 2023) and the $75 million Deutsche Bank settlement (Doe 1 v. Deutsche Bank AG, 2023) both revealed systemic compliance failures with direct congressional regulatory implications [CONFIRMED].

### The Epstein Files Transparency Act (2025)

In the 119th Congress, bipartisan legislation titled the **Epstein Files Transparency Act** was introduced in early 2025 [CORROBORATED] (Congress.gov, 2025). Key details:

- **Sponsors**: The bill attracted bipartisan support, with co-sponsors from both parties in the Senate, reflecting public demand for accountability that transcended partisan lines [CORROBORATED].
- **Legislative history**: The bill was introduced following the January 2024 document unsealing, which revealed the names of numerous Epstein associates but left significant gaps in the public record. Public polling showed overwhelming bipartisan support for full disclosure [CORROBORATED] (Montanaro, 2025).
- **Key provisions**: The Act required the executive branch to create a centralized disclosure portal for Epstein-related documents held by DOJ, FBI, DHS, and other federal agencies, modeled partly on the JFK Records Act framework. It mandated that documents be released unless specific, articulable national security or privacy concerns justified withholding, with such determinations subject to judicial review [CORROBORATED] (Congress.gov, 2025).
- **Status as of early 2026**: The executive branch began compliance with the Act's disclosure requirements, creating a DOJ document portal. However, NPR reporting in early 2026 revealed that the portal's index listed numerous files whose actual content had not been uploaded — files that were indexed by title but contained no accessible documents [CORROBORATED] (NPR, 2026).

### The Bipartisan Investigation into Withheld Files (NPR 2026)

NPR's investigative reporting in early 2026 documented a critical discrepancy: the DOJ portal created under the Epstein Files Transparency Act contained an index referencing hundreds of files, but a significant number of indexed entries led to blank pages or access-denied notices [CORROBORATED] (NPR, 2026). This reporting triggered bipartisan congressional concern:

- Members from both parties demanded explanations from DOJ regarding the gap between the portal index and accessible content [CORROBORATED].
- A bipartisan group of senators requested a classified briefing on whether any withheld files related to intelligence community equities [SINGLE SOURCE] (NPR, 2026).
- The House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the Attorney General demanding a complete accounting of which files were withheld and under what legal authority [CORROBORATED].

### What Congress Has Learned vs. What It Has Missed or Avoided

**What Congress has learned:**

1. BOP failures were systemic, not merely the result of two negligent guards [CONFIRMED].
2. The 2008 NPA was extraordinary in its secrecy and scope of immunity [CONFIRMED] (OPR Report, referenced in Acosta confirmation hearings, 2019).
3. JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank maintained financial relationships with Epstein despite internal red flags [CONFIRMED] (settlement agreements, 2023).
4. Epstein's network was extensive, involving dozens of named associates across multiple countries [CONFIRMED] (Giuffre v. Maxwell unsealed documents, 2024).

**What Congress has missed or avoided:**

1. **No systematic hearing on the 2008 NPA decision chain**: Despite Secretary Acosta's resignation in 2019, Congress never convened a comprehensive hearing examining every DOJ official involved in the NPA, the role of the FBI's Miami field office, or the internal deliberations that led to the unprecedented immunity provisions [CORROBORATED].
2. **No intelligence community hearing**: Neither the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence nor the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has publicly addressed allegations of Epstein's intelligence connections, despite Alexander Acosta's reported statement that Epstein "belonged to intelligence" [SINGLE SOURCE] (Vicky Ward reporting, referenced in Daily Beast, 2019). #claim — This statement is attributed to Acosta but has not been independently confirmed by Acosta himself.
3. **No banking regulation hearing**: The House Financial Services Committee failed to examine the systemic AML/BSA failures revealed by the JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank cases [CORROBORATED].
4. **No academic funding hearing**: Neither the Senate HELP Committee nor the House Education Committee examined the flow of Epstein-linked funds to MIT, Harvard, and other institutions [CORROBORATED].
5. **No comprehensive victim testimony**: While individual survivors have testified in sentencing proceedings and civil cases, Congress has not held a dedicated hearing featuring survivor testimony about the systemic failures that enabled their abuse [CORROBORATED].

## II. THE WITHHELD FILES CONTROVERSY

### NPR Reporting: Files in DOJ Portal Index with Missing Content

NPR's 2026 investigative reporting revealed that the DOJ disclosure portal, created under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, contained a systematic pattern of indexed-but-inaccessible files [CORROBORATED] (NPR, 2026). Specifically:

- The portal index listed file titles, dates, and originating agencies for hundreds of documents.
- A substantial subset of these indexed entries linked to pages with no content, redacted-to-blank documents, or access-denied error messages.
- The missing files appeared to cluster around specific categories: (a) FBI investigative files from the 1996–2007 period; (b) documents related to Epstein's financial network and offshore entities; and (c) files from agencies other than DOJ, including possible intelligence community-originated documents [CORROBORATED] (NPR, 2026).

The pattern suggested that the indexing was performed comprehensively but that the actual disclosure decision was made separately, with certain files withheld at a stage after indexing but before publication [CORROBORATED].

### The Executive Privilege Question

The Trump administration, in office during the relevant disclosure period beginning January 2025, faced the question of what legal basis existed for withholding files from the congressionally mandated portal. Several legal theories were reportedly invoked:

- **Executive privilege**: The administration reportedly considered asserting executive privilege over certain files reflecting presidential communications or deliberative process materials from prior administrations [SINGLE SOURCE]. However, executive privilege is generally held by the sitting president and applies to communications involving the president or senior advisors in their advisory capacity. Its application to law enforcement investigative files is legally tenuous under *United States v. Nixon* (1974), which held that executive privilege must yield to demonstrated, specific need in criminal proceedings [CONFIRMED].

- **Law enforcement sensitive / grand jury material**: Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), grand jury materials are subject to strict secrecy requirements. This is a more legally defensible basis for withholding, though Congress can seek judicial authorization for disclosure, as it did during Watergate [CONFIRMED] (In re Report & Recommendation of June 5, 1972 Grand Jury, D.C. Cir., 1974).

- **Intelligence community equities**: If any files originated from or contained information derived from intelligence sources and methods, the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) and Executive Order 13526 governing classified information would provide a basis for withholding from public disclosure, though not necessarily from congressional intelligence committees with appropriate clearances [CONFIRMED].

### Congressional Subpoena Power

Congress possesses broad subpoena power under the inherent authority of each chamber, codified in statutes such as 2 U.S.C. § 192 (contempt of Congress) and reinforced by Supreme Court precedent in *McGrain v. Daugherty* (1927), which held that Congress has the power to compel testimony and documents as an essential adjunct to the legislative function [CONFIRMED].

Key constraints and dynamics:

1. **Enforcement**: Congressional subpoenas are enforceable through three mechanisms: inherent contempt (the sergeant-at-arms physically compelling compliance — rarely used since the 19th century), criminal contempt referral to DOJ (problematic when DOJ itself is the target), and civil enforcement through federal courts [CONFIRMED].
2. **Executive branch resistance**: The executive branch has historically resisted certain congressional subpoenas by asserting executive privilege or other doctrines. The Supreme Court in *Trump v. Mazars USA* (2020) articulated a balancing test for congressional subpoenas seeking presidential information, though this case addressed third-party subpoenas rather than direct subpoenas to executive agencies [CONFIRMED].
3. **The accommodation doctrine**: In practice, disputes between Congress and the executive branch over document production are typically resolved through negotiation and accommodation rather than litigation, a process that can take months or years [CORROBORATED].

### Historical Precedent: Senate Watergate Committee vs. Executive Privilege

The most directly analogous historical precedent is the Senate Watergate Committee's confrontation with the Nixon administration in 1973–1974. Key parallels:

- The Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities (the "Ervin Committee") subpoenaed White House tapes and documents. President Nixon asserted executive privilege [CONFIRMED].
- The D.C. Circuit in *Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon* (1974) held that the committee's need for the tapes did not overcome executive privilege in that specific case, partly because the special prosecutor had already obtained the same materials through the grand jury process [CONFIRMED].
- However, the Supreme Court in *United States v. Nixon* (1974) — involving the special prosecutor's subpoena rather than the committee's — held that executive privilege was not absolute and must yield when outweighed by the demonstrated need for evidence in criminal proceedings [CONFIRMED].

The Epstein context differs because no active criminal prosecution is pending (Epstein is deceased, Maxwell was convicted, and no additional federal indictments have been publicly announced as of early 2026). This arguably weakens the argument for compelled disclosure under the *Nixon* criminal-process rationale but strengthens the argument for congressional oversight authority, as Congress may be the only institution positioned to conduct further accountability review [CORROBORATED].

### What the Missing Files Might Contain: Analytical Assessment

Based on the categories of indexed-but-inaccessible files reported by NPR, and drawing on the public evidentiary record, the following analytical assessment can be offered regarding what the withheld files might contain:

1. **FBI investigative files from 1996–2007**: These likely include documentation of the 1996 complaint by Maria Farmer to the FBI's New York field office, which was not acted upon for approximately nine years [CORROBORATED] (Farmer testimony in various proceedings). They may also include records from the FBI's Palm Beach investigation (2005–2007), which developed substantial evidence of trafficking but resulted in the NPA rather than federal prosecution [CONFIRMED]. These files could reveal the internal decision-making process at both FBI and DOJ that led to the prosecution's effective termination.

2. **Financial network documents**: Given the extensive discovery produced in the JPMorgan and USVI civil litigation, withheld files may include FinCEN materials, Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), and financial intelligence that maps Epstein's offshore structures and the flow of funds to and from his accounts. SARs are particularly sensitive because they are filed confidentially by financial institutions and are not typically disclosed publicly [CONFIRMED] (31 U.S.C. § 5318(g)).

3. **Intelligence-related materials**: If Epstein had any relationship with any intelligence agency — U.S. or foreign — files reflecting that relationship would be among the most closely held. The persistent public question of whether Epstein had intelligence connections remains unanswered by the official record [UNVERIFIED]. #claim — No confirmed evidence establishes that Epstein was an intelligence asset; this remains alleged.

4. **Co-conspirator identification materials**: The 2008 NPA granted immunity to unnamed "potential co-conspirators." Files identifying these individuals and the evidence against them would be among the most significant undisclosed materials [CORROBORATED].

## III. DOJ ACCOUNTABILITY — WHAT HASN'T HAPPENED

### OPR Review of the Acosta NPA

The Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) conducted a review of the 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta and his office. Key facts:

- The OPR review was initiated after sustained public and congressional pressure following Epstein's 2019 arrest [CONFIRMED] (DOJ, 2019).
- OPR's mandate is to investigate allegations of misconduct by DOJ attorneys. Its findings are typically shared with the Attorney General and relevant supervisory officials but are not automatically made public [CONFIRMED].
- As of early 2026, the full OPR report on the Acosta NPA has not been publicly released [CORROBORATED]. Partial findings were referenced during Acosta's confirmation process for Secretary of Labor in 2017 and in subsequent reporting, but the complete document remains nonpublic.
- OPR reportedly found that Acosta exercised "poor judgment" but did not commit professional misconduct as defined by OPR standards [SINGLE SOURCE] (referenced in multiple news reports, though the underlying document is not public). #claim — This characterization is based on reporting about OPR findings that have not been independently verified through the released document.

**Congressional remedy**: Congress could subpoena the complete OPR report, hold hearings on its findings, and legislatively mandate that OPR reports involving plea agreements or non-prosecution agreements in cases involving more than a specified number of identified victims be made public, with appropriate redactions for privacy [analytical recommendation].

### CVRA Violation: Congressional Remedy

The Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, requires that crime victims be treated with fairness and respect, be reasonably protected from the accused, be notified of court proceedings, and have the right to confer with the prosecution [CONFIRMED]. In *In re Wild* (S.D. Fla. 2019), Judge Kenneth Marra ruled that the Acosta office violated the CVRA by failing to notify Epstein's victims before entering the NPA [CONFIRMED] (In re Wild, No. 08-80736, S.D. Fla., Feb. 21, 2019).

However, Judge Marra's ruling came after the NPA had already been executed and Epstein had completed his state sentence. The ruling had no practical enforcement consequence — it declared the violation but provided no remedy [CONFIRMED].

**Congressional reform options:**

1. **CVRA Amendment — Mandatory Victim Notification with Enforcement Teeth**: Amend § 3771 to require that any NPA or DPA in cases involving identified victims of violent crime or sex trafficking must include documented proof of victim notification and an opportunity to be heard before the agreement is finalized. Failure to comply would render the agreement voidable [analytical recommendation].

2. **Judicial Review Requirement**: Require court approval of NPAs and DPAs in cases involving identified victims, modeled on the judicial review already required for consent decrees. This would create an independent check on prosecutorial discretion [analytical recommendation].

3. **Private Right of Action Enhancement**: Strengthen the CVRA's enforcement mechanism by creating a clearer private right of action for victims to challenge NPAs/DPAs that were negotiated in violation of victim notification requirements, with the remedy being reopening of the prosecution rather than mere declaratory relief [analytical recommendation].

### The Intelligence Community Declination Claim

The allegation that Epstein "belonged to intelligence" — attributed to Alexander Acosta in a reported conversation — has never been officially confirmed or denied [SINGLE SOURCE] (Ward, 2019). #claim

The Gang of Eight — the eight members of Congress who receive the most sensitive intelligence briefings — has jurisdiction over covert actions and sensitive intelligence matters under the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (50 U.S.C. § 3093). If any intelligence agency had a relationship with Epstein that influenced prosecution decisions, the Gang of Eight would be the appropriate congressional recipients of that information [CONFIRMED — regarding jurisdiction, not regarding the existence of such a relationship].

**What has not happened:**

- No public confirmation that the Gang of Eight has been briefed on any Epstein-intelligence connection [UNVERIFIED].
- No public statement from any member of the intelligence committees confirming or denying such a briefing.
- No Inspector General investigation at CIA, NSA, or any other intelligence agency has been publicly announced regarding Epstein [CORROBORATED — absence of public record].

### Inspector General Investigations: FBI Inaction on 1996 Farmer Complaint

Maria Farmer reported to the FBI in 1996 that she and her minor sister had been sexually assaulted by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell [CORROBORATED] (Farmer public statements and testimony in multiple proceedings). The FBI's New York field office received this complaint. No investigation resulted in action for approximately nine years, until the Palm Beach Police Department independently developed a case in 2005 [CORROBORATED].

The DOJ Inspector General has not publicly announced a completed investigation into why the 1996 Farmer complaint was not acted upon [CORROBORATED — absence of public record]. This represents a critical accountability gap:

- If the FBI received a credible complaint of sexual assault involving a minor and failed to investigate, this would constitute a serious dereliction.
- If the complaint was investigated and a decision was made not to pursue it, the basis for that decision should be documented and subject to review.
- If any external influence — from Epstein's attorneys, from any other entity — caused the complaint to be suppressed, this would constitute potential obstruction.

**Congressional remedy**: The Senate Judiciary Committee has oversight jurisdiction over the FBI. A directed IG investigation, mandated by committee resolution and accompanied by a subpoena for all records related to the 1996 complaint, would be appropriate [analytical recommendation].

### Jurisdictional Map: What Subcommittees Have Jurisdiction

- **Senate Judiciary Committee**: DOJ, FBI, BOP, federal prosecution policy, CVRA enforcement
- **Senate Banking Committee**: Financial institution compliance, BSA/AML, FinCEN
- **Senate Intelligence Committee**: Intelligence community connections, declination claims
- **Senate HELP Committee**: Academic institution funding, research integrity
- **House Judiciary Committee**: DOJ oversight, prosecution reform
- **House Financial Services Committee**: Banking regulation, AML reform
- **House Intelligence Committee**: Intelligence oversight (mirror of Senate)
- **House Education and Workforce Committee**: Academic institution accountability

The fragmentation of jurisdiction across multiple committees has contributed to the absence of comprehensive investigation. No single committee has claimed ownership of the "Epstein enterprise" as a whole [CORROBORATED].

## IV. BANKING REGULATORY REFORM

### What JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank Failures Reveal

The 2023 civil settlements — JPMorgan Chase paying $365 million to settle claims by Epstein survivors (and $75 million to the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Deutsche Bank paying $75 million to settle survivor claims — exposed fundamental failures in Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance [CONFIRMED] (Doe 1 v. JPMorgan Chase, S.D.N.Y., 2023; Doe 1 v. Deutsche Bank AG, S.D.N.Y., 2023; Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands v. JPMorgan Chase, S.D.N.Y., 2023).

**JPMorgan Chase key failures:**

1. Maintained Epstein as a client from 1998 through 2013, including after his 2008 conviction as a sex offender [CONFIRMED].
2. Internal emails showed senior bank executives, including former executive Jes Staley, maintaining personal relationships with Epstein and facilitating his continued banking access [CONFIRMED] (court filings in USVI v. JPMorgan Chase).
3. The bank processed transactions that included large cash withdrawals and wire transfers to individuals and entities that, upon later review, were connected to Epstein's trafficking operation [CORROBORATED].
4. Despite internal compliance flags, no Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) were filed regarding Epstein's account activity during the period of the banking relationship, or SARs that were filed were not adequately escalated [CORROBORATED].

**Deutsche Bank key failures:**

1. Onboarded Epstein as a client in 2013 — after JPMorgan dropped him — despite his status as a registered sex offender [CONFIRMED].
2. Processed approximately $150 million in transactions through Epstein accounts between 2013 and 2018, including payments to individuals who had been publicly identified as Epstein co-conspirators or victims [CONFIRMED] (NYDFS Consent Order, July 2020).
3. The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) found that Deutsche Bank failed to properly monitor account activity, failed to scrutinize suspicious transactions, and failed to conduct adequate due diligence on a high-risk client [CONFIRMED] (NYDFS, 2020).
4. Deutsche Bank paid a $150 million penalty to NYDFS in connection with these failures — a regulatory action separate from the civil settlements with survivors [CONFIRMED].

### Whether SARs Were Filed and Shared with Law Enforcement

The SAR system is a critical component of BSA/AML compliance. Financial institutions are required to file SARs with FinCEN when they detect suspicious transactions, and FinCEN is responsible for making this information available to law enforcement [CONFIRMED] (31 U.S.C. § 5318(g)).

- **JPMorgan**: The evidentiary record from the civil litigation suggests that JPMorgan either failed to file SARs regarding Epstein's suspicious activity or filed them belatedly and inadequately [CORROBORATED]. The full SAR filing history remains nonpublic, as SARs are confidential under federal law.
- **Deutsche Bank**: NYDFS found that Deutsche Bank failed to adequately monitor Epstein's accounts and did not file timely SARs [CONFIRMED] (NYDFS Consent Order, 2020).
- **Law enforcement access**: Even when SARs are filed, their utility depends on law enforcement agencies querying FinCEN's database. There is no public evidence that the FBI or DOJ queried FinCEN for Epstein-related SARs during the 2013–2018 period when Deutsche Bank was processing his transactions [UNVERIFIED]. If SARs were filed but never queried, this represents a systemic gap in the intelligence-to-investigation pipeline.

### FinCEN Reform: Enhanced Due Diligence and Personal Liability

The Epstein case exposes several specific gaps in the current BSA/AML framework:

1. **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) for convicted sex offenders**: Current EDD requirements focus primarily on Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and high-risk jurisdictions. There is no specific regulatory requirement mandating EDD for individuals convicted of sex offenses, despite the strong correlation between sex trafficking and financial crimes [analytical observation]. **Recommendation**: FinCEN should issue guidance or Congress should legislate EDD requirements for customers with convictions for sex offenses, trafficking, or related crimes [analytical recommendation].

2. **Personal liability for compliance officers**: The current enforcement framework primarily imposes institutional penalties. Individual compliance officers who sign off on maintaining high-risk relationships despite red flags face limited personal liability. **Recommendation**: Legislation creating personal civil liability for chief compliance officers who authorize maintenance of banking relationships in the face of documented trafficking-related red flags, modeled on Sarbanes-Oxley officer certification requirements [analytical recommendation].

3. **FinCEN beneficial ownership registry**: The Corporate Transparency Act (2021) required FinCEN to create a beneficial ownership registry [CONFIRMED]. Full implementation of this registry, with robust search capabilities for law enforcement, would help identify the kind of complex offshore structures Epstein used to obscure the flow of funds.

### The "De-Risking" Paradox

A persistent tension in AML reform is the "de-risking" phenomenon: when banks, facing regulatory pressure, simply terminate relationships with categories of customers deemed high-risk rather than investing in enhanced monitoring. This is counterproductive because it pushes suspicious activity to less-regulated institutions where monitoring is weaker [CORROBORATED] (FinCEN, 2014).

In the Epstein context, JPMorgan's eventual termination of Epstein's accounts in 2013 did not end his access to the banking system — it merely shifted him to Deutsche Bank, which had weaker compliance [CONFIRMED]. The solution is not to encourage banks to drop customers but to ensure that when high-risk customers are maintained, monitoring is genuinely rigorous and that when they are terminated, the termination triggers a SAR and inter-institutional communication [analytical recommendation].

### Proposed Legislation: Trafficking-Specific AML Requirements

Congress should consider legislation that:

1. Creates a specific SAR category for transactions suspected of being connected to sex trafficking, enabling FinCEN to more easily aggregate and analyze trafficking-related financial intelligence.
2. Requires financial institutions that terminate a customer relationship due to trafficking-related concerns to file a termination SAR and notify FinCEN's law enforcement liaison unit.
3. Mandates annual trafficking-specific training for compliance staff at financial institutions above a specified asset threshold.
4. Creates a private right of action for trafficking survivors against financial institutions that knowingly or recklessly facilitated trafficking through inadequate compliance, modeled on § 1595 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act [analytical recommendations].

---

## V. PROSECUTION REFORM — CLOSING THE NPA LOOPHOLE

### Statutory Reform: Victim Notification in NPA/DPA Negotiations

The Epstein NPA stands as the most consequential example of prosecutorial discretion exercised in a manner that directly harmed identified crime victims. The agreement was negotiated in secret, victims were not notified, and when victims' attorney Brad Edwards sought information, he was told the matter was being handled [CONFIRMED] (Edwards, 2019; In re Wild, 2019).

**Proposed reform**: Amend 18 U.S.C. § 3771 (CVRA) and relevant DOJ policy (the "Filip Factors" governing DPAs, and the Principles of Federal Prosecution) to require:

1. Mandatory written notification to all identified victims at least 30 days before finalization of any NPA or DPA in cases involving violent crimes, sex offenses, or trafficking.
2. A victim impact statement opportunity before the NPA/DPA is executed.
3. Filing of the NPA/DPA with the relevant federal district court, with a reasonableness review by the presiding judge [analytical recommendations].

### The Secret Immunity Problem

The Epstein NPA contained a provision granting immunity to unnamed "potential co-conspirators" [CONFIRMED] (Non-Prosecution Agreement, 2007, filed in In re Wild). This meant that individuals who may have participated in Epstein's trafficking operation received legal protection without being identified, without the victims' knowledge, and without judicial review.

**Proposed reform**: Legislation requiring:

1. Any NPA or DPA provision granting immunity to individuals other than the named defendant must identify those individuals by name in a filing submitted to the court under seal.
2. The court must review the basis for the immunity grant and determine that it serves the interests of justice.
3. Victims must be notified that co-conspirator immunity has been granted, even if the identities of the co-conspirators remain sealed for investigative purposes.
4. A sunset provision: co-conspirator immunity granted under an NPA/DPA expires after a fixed period (e.g., 10 years) unless renewed by court order upon a showing that the immunity continues to serve a legitimate law enforcement purpose [analytical recommendations].

### Mandatory Minimum Reform

Federal sex trafficking carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years under 18 U.S.C. § 1591 [CONFIRMED]. The Epstein NPA effectively circumvented this by resolving the matter through a state plea to lesser charges (solicitation of prostitution) carrying an 18-month sentence, of which Epstein served approximately 13 months, much of it on work release [CONFIRMED].

**Proposed reform**: Legislation providing that in cases where federal authorities have developed evidence sufficient to charge sex trafficking under § 1591, resolution through a state plea to lesser charges may not be used to circumvent federal mandatory minimums unless the relevant federal district court approves the disposition after a hearing at which victims have been heard [analytical recommendation].

### Victim Compensation Fund

The civil settlement process in the Epstein matter has been complex. The Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (EVCP), administered by claims administrator Jordana Feldman, distributed over $121 million to approximately 150 claimants [CONFIRMED] (Epstein Victims' Compensation Program, 2020–2021). Additional compensation came through civil litigation against JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, and the Epstein estate.

However, significant gaps remain:

- Not all identified victims participated in the EVCP [CORROBORATED].
- Victims in foreign countries, particularly those recruited through Epstein's operations in the U.S. Virgin Islands and abroad, faced barriers to participation [CORROBORATED].
- The civil settlements with banks were not structured as individual victim compensation but rather as class settlements, with distribution mechanisms that may not have reached all survivors [CORROBORATED].

**Proposed reform**: Creation of a federal trafficking victim compensation fund, financed through AML penalty revenues, that provides a streamlined claims process for victims of enterprises where criminal prosecution has been terminated or compromised by prosecutorial misconduct [analytical recommendation].

### CVRA Enhancement: Strengthening § 3771

The CVRA's current enforcement mechanism is inadequate. Judge Marra's 2019 ruling declared a violation but provided
