# The Les Wexner–Jeffrey Epstein Financial Relationship: A Definitive Analysis

---

## I. WHO IS LES WEXNER

### A. The Architect of American Retail

Leslie Herbert Wexner (b. September 8, 1937, Dayton, Ohio) is among the most consequential figures in the history of American retail. The son of Harry and Bella Wexner, Russian-Jewish immigrants who operated a modest clothing store in Columbus, Ohio, Wexner founded The Limited in 1963 with a $5,000 loan from his aunt (Wexner, 2003; Reingold, 1996). By the late 1980s, he had built that single store into a retail empire encompassing Victoria's Secret (acquired 1982), Bath & Body Works (founded 1990), Abercrombie & Fitch (acquired 1988, later spun off in 1998), Lane Bryant (acquired 1982), Express, and Henri Bendel [CONFIRMED] (L Brands, Inc., Annual Report, 2000).

By the time Jeffrey Epstein entered his life, Wexner's personal net worth was estimated between $2.5 billion and $4.2 billion, placing him consistently among the wealthiest individuals in America (Forbes, 1990–2007). His L Brands (originally The Limited, Inc., later renamed Limited Brands, then L Brands) was headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, and at its peak operated more than 5,600 stores worldwide [CONFIRMED] (L Brands SEC 10-K filings, 1998–2007).

### B. Philanthropic and Civic Standing

Wexner's philanthropy has been extensive and focused primarily on Jewish community leadership, education, and the arts. The Wexner Foundation, established in 1983, funds the Wexner Graduate Fellowship for Jewish professionals, the Wexner Israel Fellowship, and the Wexner Heritage Program. The Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University, which opened in 1989, bears his name and was funded by a significant personal donation [CONFIRMED] (Wexner Foundation, n.d.; Ohio State University, 1989).

Within Columbus, Wexner occupied an almost patriarchal civic role. He was a leading donor to the Columbus Jewish Federation, the Jewish Community Center, Ohio State University, and numerous local charities. His influence in Columbus civic life was, by multiple accounts, without parallel—described by *Columbus Monthly* as "the most powerful man in central Ohio" (Columbus Monthly, 1995).

### C. How Epstein Entered the Wexner Orbit: c. 1987–1988

The precise origins of the Wexner-Epstein relationship remain partially obscured, but the evidentiary record points to an introduction occurring between late 1986 and early 1988. The most frequently cited account involves Robert Meister, then vice chairman of the insurance brokerage firm Aon Corporation, who has been described as having introduced the two men [CORROBORATED] (Landon Thomas Jr., *New York Magazine*, 2002; Ward, 2021; Patterson, 2021).

Epstein, at this time, had recently departed Bear Stearns (1981) under circumstances that remain disputed—he was not terminated for cause, according to some accounts, but left amid questions about his activities [CORROBORATED] (Hoffmann, 2019; Ward, 2021). He had established J. Epstein & Co. and was seeking ultra-high-net-worth clients, reportedly claiming he only managed money for billionaires (Landon Thomas Jr., 2002).

By 1988, Epstein was established as Wexner's primary financial adviser. The relationship was not merely advisory—it was, by all documented evidence, the most intimate and consequential financial relationship in either man's life. Wexner would later describe Epstein in terms suggesting near-familial trust: multiple associates recalled Wexner referring to Epstein as being like a brother or describing the relationship as uniquely close [CORROBORATED] (Levy, *New York Times*, 2019; Ward, 2021).

The speed and depth of Epstein's integration into Wexner's financial affairs was, by any standard financial advisory measure, extraordinary. Within approximately two years of their introduction, Epstein would hold the broadest possible legal authority over Wexner's personal finances.

---

## II. THE POWER OF ATTORNEY — LEGAL ANATOMY

### A. What a Broad Power of Attorney Permits

A general or "broad" power of attorney (POA) is one of the most consequential legal instruments in American law. Under the Uniform Power of Attorney Act (adopted with variations by most U.S. states) and applicable state statutes (including Ohio Rev. Code § 1337.21 et seq. and New York Gen. Oblig. Law § 5-1501 et seq.), a general POA authorizes an agent (attorney-in-fact) to act on behalf of the principal in virtually all financial and legal matters, including but not limited to:

- Buying, selling, mortgaging, or transferring real property
- Opening, closing, and managing bank and brokerage accounts
- Entering into contracts on the principal's behalf
- Filing tax returns and engaging with government agencies
- Creating, amending, or dissolving trusts and corporate entities
- Making gifts from the principal's assets (if gifting authority is included)
- Borrowing money and pledging the principal's assets as collateral

A broad POA effectively places the agent in the legal shoes of the principal. Third parties—banks, title companies, brokerages—are generally entitled to rely on the POA's face validity and transact with the agent as though transacting with the principal directly (Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.03, 2006).

### B. The Specific Scope Granted to Epstein

The precise text of the power of attorney granted by Wexner to Epstein has not been released in full publicly. However, its existence and extraordinarily broad scope have been confirmed through multiple channels:

1. **Wexner's own 2019 acknowledgment**: In his August 2019 letter to the Wexner Foundation, Wexner confirmed that Epstein had been granted "power of attorney" and had "misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family" [CONFIRMED] (Wexner, 2019, letter to Wexner Foundation).

2. **Civil litigation filings**: Documents produced in the *Jane Doe v. Epstein* and related civil proceedings in the Southern District of Florida, as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands litigation against JPMorgan Chase (*Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands v. JPMorgan Chase & Co.*, No. 22-cv-10904, SDNY), reference the Wexner-Epstein POA and characterize it as providing Epstein with essentially unlimited authority over Wexner's financial affairs [CORROBORATED] (USVI v. JPMorgan, Complaint, 2022; Giuffre v. Maxwell, SDNY, unsealed documents, 2019–2024).

3. **Maria Farmer's account**: Maria Farmer, one of the earliest Epstein accusers, described Epstein presenting himself as having total control over Wexner's finances during the mid-1990s, including authorizing real estate transactions and managing investment portfolios [SINGLE SOURCE] (Farmer, deposition testimony, 2019–2020; Webb, 2019).

4. **Former Wexner associates**: Multiple unnamed former associates of Wexner have confirmed to journalists that Epstein possessed a general power of attorney and exercised it actively in managing Wexner's affairs [CORROBORATED] (Stewart, *New York Times*, 2019; Ward, 2021).

### C. Comparison to Normal Financial Advisory

The arrangement between Wexner and Epstein was, by any measure, radically beyond standard financial advisory or wealth management relationships. A standard comparison illuminates the anomaly:

| Feature | Standard Wealth Management | Wexner–Epstein Arrangement |
|---|---|---|
| **Legal authority** | Limited trading authorization within defined accounts | General power of attorney over all assets |
| **Oversight** | Independent custodian, compliance reporting, audited statements | Minimal independent oversight documented |
| **Compensation** | Defined fee schedule (typically 0.5–2% AUM or performance-based) | No publicly documented fee agreement |
| **Fiduciary monitoring** | Client receives regular statements from custodian | Unclear whether independent custodial reporting was maintained |
| **Real estate authority** | None, absent specific authorization | Full authority to buy, sell, and transfer real property |
| **Duration** | Typically renewed annually or on specific terms | Approximately 20 years (c. 1988–2007) |
| **Termination** | Clear contractual provisions | No publicly documented termination provisions |

Wealth management professionals consulted by *The New York Times* and *The Wall Street Journal* in 2019 uniformly described the arrangement as unprecedented in their experience [CORROBORATED] (Stewart, 2019; Palazzolo & Rothfeld, 2019).

### D. What the POA Could Authorize Without Wexner's Explicit Consent

Under the legal doctrine of agency, an agent acting within the scope of a valid POA can bind the principal to transactions even without the principal's specific knowledge or consent for each individual transaction. This includes:

- Transferring real property from the principal's name to the agent's name or to third parties
- Moving funds between accounts, including transfers to entities controlled by the agent
- Entering into investment agreements, joint ventures, or other financial commitments
- Making charitable or political contributions from the principal's funds
- Establishing trusts or corporate entities funded with the principal's money

The critical legal question is whether such transactions fall within the scope of authority granted by the POA and whether they were undertaken for the principal's benefit (a fiduciary duty) or for the agent's personal benefit (a potential breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud) (Restatement (Third) of Agency §§ 8.01–8.12, 2006).

### E. The Liability Question

Under agency law, a principal is generally bound by acts of the agent within the scope of the agent's authority, even if the agent acted improperly in executing those acts. However:

1. **Third-party reliance**: If Epstein used the POA to enter into transactions with third parties—banks, real estate sellers, investment counterparties—Wexner would generally be bound by those transactions vis-à-vis the third parties [CONFIRMED — standard legal doctrine].

2. **Wexner's potential recourse**: If Epstein exceeded the POA's scope or breached his fiduciary duty to Wexner, Wexner's remedy would be against Epstein personally (or his estate) for breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, or constructive fraud.

3. **Third-party victim claims**: The more consequential question is whether victims of Epstein's criminal conduct can reach Wexner's assets on the theory that Wexner was negligent in supervising his agent or that Wexner's wealth, channeled through Epstein, funded criminal activity. This is analyzed in Section VII below.

---

## III. THE 9 EAST 71ST STREET TRANSFER — THE CENTRAL MYSTERY

### A. The Purchase

In 1989, Les Wexner purchased the Herbert N. Straus mansion at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York 10021, for approximately $13.2 million [CONFIRMED] (New York City Department of Finance, property transfer records, 1989; Stewart, 2019). The property is a six-story, approximately 21,000-square-foot limestone townhouse located on the south side of 71st Street between Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue, steps from the Frick Collection and Central Park.

Wexner subsequently undertook extensive renovations, reportedly spending an additional $8–10 million bringing the total investment to approximately $21–23 million [CORROBORATED] (Ward, 2021; Patterson, 2021). The property was Wexner's primary New York residence during a period when he maintained a significant presence in the city for L Brands business.

### B. The Transfer

By the mid-to-late 1990s, the property appeared in public records as being under Epstein's control or ownership. The precise mechanism and date of transfer have been subjects of intense scrutiny:

1. **New York City property records** show that by 1998, the property was held by a trust or entity associated with Epstein [CONFIRMED] (NYC Department of Finance; Stewart, 2019). Some records indicate a transfer date as early as 1996 [CORROBORATED] (Palazzolo & Rothfeld, *Wall Street Journal*, 2019).

2. **The transfer price**: Public records indicate a nominal transfer price. In some filings, the consideration is listed as either $0 or a nominal figure, strongly suggesting a gift or POA-executed transfer rather than an arm's-length sale [CORROBORATED] (NYC property records; Ward, 2021; Stewart, 2019).

3. **No publicly recorded mortgage**: The property appears to have been transferred without a mortgage, indicating a free-and-clear conveyance [CORROBORATED] (NYC Department of Finance records).

### C. What Transfer Documents Say

Full transfer documentation has not been released publicly despite being referenced in multiple civil proceedings. What is known from court filings and investigative reporting:

- The deed transfer was executed using instruments consistent with the POA, meaning Epstein may have signed on Wexner's behalf or the transfer was effected through an entity Epstein controlled under the POA's authority [CORROBORATED] (Ward, 2021; USVI v. JPMorgan, 2022).

- Wexner has not publicly produced a separate purchase agreement, bill of sale, or independent documentation showing an arm's-length negotiation for the property transfer.

- In the JPMorgan litigation, the USVI characterized the townhouse transfer as part of Epstein's pattern of extracting wealth from Wexner and using it to fund his operations and lifestyle [CORROBORATED] (USVI v. JPMorgan, Complaint, 2022).

### D. Three Theories

**Theory 1: Gift**

Wexner voluntarily gifted the property to Epstein, either as compensation for financial services, as a personal gift reflecting their close relationship, or for estate-planning purposes. Under federal gift tax law (26 U.S.C. § 2501), a gift of this magnitude (valued at $20+ million by the mid-1990s) would trigger substantial gift tax liability. No evidence of a filed gift tax return for this transfer has been publicly identified [UNVERIFIED — absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, as IRS returns are confidential].

**Theory 2: Sale Below Market Value**

Wexner sold the property to Epstein at a price substantially below fair market value. A below-market sale would constitute a partial gift under IRS regulations (Treas. Reg. § 25.2512-8) and would still trigger gift tax on the differential. This theory is weakened by the absence of any documented purchase price near market value in public records [SINGLE SOURCE — inference from property records].

**Theory 3: POA-Executed Transfer Without Explicit Consent**

Epstein used the broad POA to transfer the property to himself or an entity he controlled, potentially without Wexner's specific knowledge or explicit authorization for this particular transaction. This theory is most consistent with Wexner's 2019 statement that he was "misled" and that Epstein "misappropriated vast sums" [CORROBORATED] (Wexner, 2019; Stewart, 2019).

However, this theory raises profound questions:

- How did Wexner not notice for years that his $21+ million Manhattan townhouse was no longer in his name?
- If Wexner was aware and consented, his 2019 statement is misleading.
- If Wexner was truly unaware, it suggests a catastrophic failure of personal financial oversight for one of America's wealthiest individuals.

### E. Tax Implications

| Scenario | Federal Tax Consequence | Documentation Required |
|---|---|---|
| Gift | Gift tax on FMV (~$20M+); potential GST tax if to trust | Form 709, appraisal |
| Below-market sale | Gift tax on difference between sale price and FMV | Form 709, sale documents, appraisal |
| Unauthorized transfer | No tax to Wexner (not a voluntary transfer); potential theft/fraud claim | Police report, civil action, IRS Form 4684 (theft loss) |

No public evidence has emerged that Wexner filed a theft loss claim, a police report, or an IRS Form 4684 in connection with the property transfer [UNVERIFIED — such filings would generally be non-public].

### F. Wexner's "Misled and Betrayed" Statement

In his August 7, 2019 letter to the Wexner Foundation, Wexner stated:

> "I am embarrassed that, like so many others, I was deceived by Mr. Epstein. He misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family. This was, frankly, a tremendous shock, even though it clearly pales in comparison to the offenses he committed against the young women he victimized." (Wexner, 2019)

**What this statement admits:**

- That a financial relationship of significant scope existed
- That transfers of "vast sums" occurred
- That Epstein held sufficient authority to "misappropriate" (implying the POA or equivalent access)

**What this statement denies (by implication):**

- That Wexner knowingly authorized the specific transfers Epstein made
- That Wexner benefited from or was complicit in Epstein's activities
- That Wexner maintained the relationship after discovering the misappropriation

**What this statement does not address:**

- The specific property transfer at 9 East 71st Street
- The timeline of when Wexner became aware of misappropriation
- Why Wexner did not pursue criminal charges against Epstein for theft or fraud
- The nature and amount of "vast sums" misappropriated

## IV. L BRANDS FINANCIAL FLOWS DURING THE EPSTEIN PERIOD

### A. L Brands Revenue and Profits: 1989–2007

During the period of Epstein's active involvement with Wexner, L Brands (then The Limited, Inc., later Limited Brands) experienced dramatic growth, particularly in the Victoria's Secret division:

| Year | Total Revenue (approx.) | Victoria's Secret Revenue (approx.) | Net Income (approx.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1990 | $5.3B | $1.0B | $403M |
| 1995 | $7.9B | $2.4B | $510M |
| 2000 | $10.1B | $3.6B | $428M |
| 2005 | $9.7B | $4.6B | $683M |
| 2007 | $10.7B | $5.6B | $676M |

[CONFIRMED — data from L Brands SEC 10-K filings, 1990–2007]

Victoria's Secret, in particular, became the crown jewel of the portfolio, growing from approximately $1 billion in revenue in 1990 to over $5.6 billion by 2007. This growth generated enormous personal wealth for Wexner through stock ownership and dividends.

### B. Was Epstein Involved in L Brands Sourcing Decisions?

This is one of the most sensitive and difficult questions in the investigation. The evidentiary record is as follows:

- **No publicly documented role**: Epstein held no formal corporate title, board seat, or consulting agreement with L Brands or any subsidiary that has been made public [CONFIRMED — L Brands SEC proxy filings, 1989–2007, do not list Epstein].

- **Maria Farmer's account**: Farmer has testified that Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were present at L Brands corporate events and that Epstein represented himself as having influence over Wexner's business decisions [SINGLE SOURCE] (Farmer, 2019–2020).

- **Modeling recruitment nexus**: Multiple investigative accounts have described Epstein and associates using the Victoria's Secret brand as a lure for young women, with Epstein or associates claiming to be scouts or representatives of Victoria's Secret [CORROBORATED] (Ward, 2021; Patterson, 2021; Brown, *Miami Herald*, 2018). However, whether this was done with Wexner's knowledge or L Brands' authorization is unsubstantiated.

- **L Brands internal review**: Following the 2019 publicity, L Brands engaged the Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz law firm to conduct an internal investigation. In February 2020, L Brands reported that the review found no evidence that Epstein was "involved in the operations of the company, including recruiting models" [SINGLE SOURCE — L Brands corporate statement] (L Brands, Inc., Statement, February 2020). #claim — this finding has been disputed by some accusers.

**Assessment**: There is no confirmed evidence that Epstein had a formal operational role in L Brands or Victoria's Secret sourcing decisions. There is corroborated evidence that Epstein and associates used the Victoria's Secret brand name in recruiting young women, but whether this was authorized by Wexner or L Brands remains [UNVERIFIED].

### C. The Columbus, Ohio Connection

Wexner's power base was Columbus, Ohio. L Brands headquarters (now Bath & Body Works, Inc.) is located at Three Limited Parkway, Columbus, OH 43230. Epstein maintained a presence in Ohio:

- Epstein was known to visit Columbus regularly during the period of his relationship with Wexner [CORROBORATED] (Ward, 2021; local reporting).
- The Wexner Foundation and related Wexner entities are headquartered in the Columbus area.
- Some civil filings reference Ohio-based entities or accounts in connection with the Wexner-Epstein financial relationship [SINGLE SOURCE] (various civil complaints).

### D. Documented Financial Flows

Specific dollar amounts flowing between Wexner and Epstein entities are partially documented:

1. **JPMorgan litigation**: The USVI complaint against JPMorgan Chase alleged that JPMorgan was aware that Epstein's accounts were funded in significant part by Wexner-originated transfers and that these funds were used to facilitate Epstein's criminal enterprise [CORROBORATED] (USVI v. JPMorgan, Complaint, 2022; JPMorgan settlement documents, 2023).

2. **The $46 million payment**: In 2008, after the relationship's public termination, Wexner's representatives reportedly identified approximately $46 million in "unauthorized transfers" from Wexner's accounts to Epstein or Epstein-controlled entities. Epstein reportedly returned this amount [SINGLE SOURCE] (Palazzolo & Rothfeld, *Wall Street Journal*, 2019). #claim — the $46 million figure has not been independently verified through court documents, though it is widely reported.

3. **The property at 9 East 71st Street** (value estimated at $50–77 million by 2019 assessment) [CONFIRMED — NYC Department of Finance assessment].

4. **Other transfers**: The full scope of transfers from Wexner to Epstein over the approximately 20-year relationship has not been publicly documented. Some estimates place the total at $100 million or more [UNVERIFIED] (Ward, 2021).

---

## V. THE WEALTH CREATION QUESTION

### A. The Wealth Accumulation Timeline

Epstein's documented financial trajectory:

| Period | Status | Estimated Wealth |
|---|---|---|
| 1976–1981 | Bear Stearns (trader → limited partner) | Unknown; modest by billionaire standards |
| 1981–1987 | Independent financial consultant; J. Epstein & Co. established | Unknown; no documented major assets |
| 1988–1995 | Primary financial adviser to Wexner; POA holder | Accumulating rapidly; acquires 9 E 71st St by mid-1990s |
| 1996–2005 | Expanded client base (alleged); lifestyle of extreme wealth | Estimated $500M–$1B+ |
| 2006–2008 | Florida investigation, plea deal | Assets frozen/contested |
| 2008–2019 | Post-conviction period | Estate valued at ~$634M at death [CONFIRMED — Epstein estate filing, USVI, 2019] |

### B. What Legitimate Fees Would Produce

If Epstein served as a conventional financial adviser to Wexner, managing an investment portfolio of $2–4 billion:

- **Standard management fee** (1–2% of AUM annually): $20M–$80M per year
- **Performance fee** (20% of gains above a hurdle): variable, potentially $10M–$100M+ in strong years
- **Over 20 years**: Total legitimate fees could range from $200 million to $1 billion, depending on portfolio performance and fee structure

However, there are critical complications:

1. **No documented fee agreement** has been publicly produced [CORROBORATED — absence noted by multiple investigative journalists] (Stewart, 2019; Ward, 2021).
2. **No audited track record**: Epstein never produced verified investment returns for any client [CORROBORATED] (SEC filings; Landon Thomas Jr., 2002).
3. **No other confirmed billion-dollar clients**: Despite Epstein's claim of only managing billionaires, no other client of comparable scale to Wexner has been publicly identified with certainty [CORROBORATED] (Stewart, 2019; Patterson, 2021). Leon Black's Apollo relationship (discussed in separate document) involved advisory services but operated differently.

### C. What a Broad POA Could Produce Beyond Legitimate Fees

With a general POA, Epstein could have:

- Directed investment opportunities to himself or entities he controlled
- Charged undocumented fees or commissions
- Diverted the returns on Wexner's investments while attributing them to his own accounts
- Created side arrangements with banks or investment counterparties that generated kickbacks
- Used Wexner's credit and reputation to leverage his own borrowing

The absence of independent oversight—no documented compliance officer, no independent custodial reporting to Wexner separate from Epstein's own accounts—means that the actual financial flows between the two men remain substantially opaque [CORROBORATED] (Stewart, 2019; forensic accounting observations in USVI v. JPMorgan, 2022).

### D. The "Misappropriation" Theory

The theory that a significant portion of Epstein's wealth was derived from misappropriation of Wexner's assets is consistent with:

- Wexner's own 2019 statement (acknowledging "vast sums" misappropriated)
- The $46 million repayment reported in 2008
- The 9 East 71st Street transfer
- The absence of any other documented source for Epstein's wealth of comparable magnitude

However, this theory is problematic:

- If Epstein misappropriated hundreds of millions, Wexner's failure to pursue criminal charges or a major civil recovery is remarkable for a sophisticated billionaire with access to elite legal counsel [CORROBORATED — no criminal referral or major civil suit by Wexner against Epstein documented] (Stewart, 2019).
- The $46 million repayment, if accurate, represents a fraction of Epstein's eventual wealth, suggesting either that Wexner was satisfied with partial recovery or that the total misappropriation was limited to this amount.
- It is possible that Wexner made a calculated decision not to pursue litigation that would expose the full scope of the relationship to public scrutiny.

**Assessment**: The theory that Wexner was the primary source of Epstein's wealth is [CORROBORATED] by circumstantial evidence and Wexner's own partial admissions. The specific mechanism—legitimate fees, unauthorized transfers, or some combination—remains [SINGLE SOURCE / PARTIALLY UNVERIFIED].

### E. Why Wexner Did Not Press Criminal Charges

Several explanations have been advanced:

1. **Reputational risk**: Criminal proceedings would require Wexner to testify publicly about the scope of the POA and his failure to detect misappropriation for approximately 20 years, exposing him to intense scrutiny and potential secondary liability claims.

2. **Civil resolution**: The reported $46 million repayment in 2008 may have been part of a broader private settlement [UNVERIFIED].

3. **Mutual knowledge**: The most troubling possibility—that Wexner had greater knowledge of Epstein's activities than his public statements suggest and chose not to create a forum for cross-examination under oath. #claim — this is speculative and not supported by confirmed evidence.

4. **Statute of limitations**: By 2019, criminal statutes of limitation for theft or fraud in Ohio and New York would likely have expired for most transactions [CONFIRMED — standard legal analysis].

---

## VI. WEXNER'S POST-2008 CONDUCT

### A. Contact After the 2008 Conviction

Wexner has stated that he severed all contact with Epstein after learning of the Florida criminal investigation. His 2019 letter states that the relationship ended "in 2007" (Wexner, 2019).

However, countervailing evidence includes:

- **Flight records**: Wexner is not known to have appeared on Epstein's flight logs after 2007 [CONFIRMED — based on publicly released logs] (FAA records; SDFL exhibits).
- **JPMorgan relationship**: JPMorgan maintained Epstein as a client until 2013. The USVI complaint alleged that JPMorgan executives were aware of Epstein's Wexner connection and used it as partial justification for maintaining the banking relationship [CORROBORATED] (USVI v. JPMorgan, Complaint, 2022).
- **No documented post-2007 meetings**: Investigative journalism has not established direct contact between Wexner and Epstein after 2007/2008 [CORROBORATED].

### B. DOJ File Releases (2023–2026)

Multiple tranches of Epstein-related documents have been released by the DOJ and through court-ordered unsealing in the *Giuffre v. Maxwell* case (SDNY). As of 2026-02-28:

- Wexner's name appears in documents primarily in the context of the financial relationship and as the source of Epstein's initial wealth accumulation [CONFIRMED] (DOJ files; unsealed *Giuffre v. Maxwell* exhibits, 2023–2024).
- No documents released as of this date contain evidence that Wexner participated in, witnessed, or had confirmed knowledge of Epstein's sexual offenses [CONFIRMED — based on publicly released documents as of 2026-02-28].
- Several victim depositions reference Wexner's properties (New Albany, Ohio; 9 East 71st Street) as locations where abuse occurred, but these references do not establish Wexner's presence or knowledge [CORROBORATED] (sealed and partially unsealed depositions, 2015–2024).

### C. The August 2019 Letter — Full Analysis

Wexner's letter to the Wexner Foundation, dated August 7, 2019 (four days before Epstein's death on August 10, 2019), was his most substantive public statement. Key passages:

> **On the relationship's origin**: "I met him through friends of mine and he presented himself as a financial professional." [Note: No mention of the POA's extraordinary scope]

> **On the misappropriation**: "He misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family."

> **On the property**: The letter does not specifically address the 9 East 71st Street transfer.

> **On Epstein's criminal conduct**: "I am embarrassed that, like so many others, I was deceived by Mr. Epstein."

> **On the timeline**: "Being taken advantage of by someone who was so sick, so cunning, so depraved, is something that I'm not able to fully explain."

**Analysis**: The letter is carefully lawyered. It:

- Positions Wexner as a victim of Epstein, not a facilitator
- Acknowledges financial misappropriation but provides no specifics
- Does not address when Wexner first became aware of misappropriation
- Does not explain why criminal charges were not pursued
- Does not address any knowledge of Epstein's personal conduct prior to the 2005 Palm Beach investigation
- Uses the passive construction "being taken advantage of," which avoids describing Wexner's own actions or inactions

### D. Civil Proceedings Involving Wexner

As of 2026-02-28, Les Wexner has not been named as a defendant in any criminal proceeding related to Epstein. In civil litigation:

1. **USVI v. JPMorgan Chase**: Wexner was referenced extensively as Epstein's primary financial source but was not a party to the action [CONFIRMED] (USVI v. JPMorgan, 2022–2023).

2. **Epstein Victims' Compensation Program**: The fund, administered by Kenneth Feinberg and Jordana
