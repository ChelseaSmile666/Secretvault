## The "Temple" on Little Saint James — Documented

### Physical Structure
- A distinctive structure on [[Locations/Little-Saint-James-USVI]] was widely photographed from the air and sea
- Described variously as a "temple," "shrine," or "building with dome"
- Key features documented in photographs:
  - Blue-and-white striped exterior walls (noted as similar to Egyptian or Masonic architectural motifs by some analysts #claim)
  - Gold dome roof (later removed or damaged)
  - No windows — unusual for a residential structure
  - Heavy door resembling vault or bunker entrance
  - Located on elevated ground away from main residence

### Demolition After Arrest
- After Epstein's July 2019 arrest, the dome was reportedly removed or collapsed
- Workers were observed at the structure post-arrest
- Aerial photographs confirm the dome's disappearance between 2019 and 2020
- Reason for demolition/alteration not established; timing is notable

### What The Structure Was
- Official purpose: never publicly established
- Various accounts from workers and observers #claim:
  - A music venue (claimed by some)
  - A gym (claimed by others)
  - Purpose-built private space with no windows (noted by multiple observers)
- The Virgin Islands AG investigation examined the property; full findings not publicly released

## Symbolism Analysis — Documented Interpretations

### Architectural Parallels Noted by Researchers

| Motif | Documented Occurrence | Context |
|-------|----------------------|---------|
| Blue/white stripes | Little Saint James "temple" exterior | Noted by multiple journalists and researchers |
| Gold dome | Little Saint James structure (pre-2019) | Visible in aerial photos |
| Owl statue | On the property (reported by multiple sources) | Owl = Bohemian Grove symbol; also Minervan/Illuminati symbolism in popular culture |
| Sundial/astronomical features | Reported on the island #claim | Not independently verified |

### The Owl
- An owl statue was reportedly located on the grounds of Little Saint James
- The owl is the central symbol of the **Bohemian Grove** (see [[Findings/Secret-Societies-Elite-Networks]])
- Whether Epstein placed it deliberately is unknown; the coincidence with Bohemian Grove is noted #claim

## Bohemian Grove — The "Moloch" / "Cremation of Care" Ceremony (Documented)

### What Actually Happens (Documented)
- Alex Jones infiltrated and filmed (2000)
- The ceremony involves a 40-foot stone owl statue ("Moloch" per some analysts, though Grove calls it "the owl")
- Participants in robes carry a coffin representing "Care" (worldly concerns)
- A figure representing Care is burned in effigy before the owl/altar
- The ceremony is theatrical — a dramatic performance — not literal worship
- The script references "Dull Care" and ancient Canaanite themes

### Documented Participants (in Bohemian Grove, not claiming the ceremony is "real" worship)
- Richard Nixon: described it as "the most faggy goddamn thing you could ever imagine" in White House tapes — confirms attendance
- Ronald Reagan: attended pre-presidency
- George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush: documented members
- Henry Kissinger: documented member (see [[People/Henry-Kissinger]])
- Documented in: Washington Post, Spy Magazine, Sacramento Bee reporting

### Connection to Epstein Network
- Multiple documented Bohemian Grove members appear in Epstein's network
- Whether Epstein attended Bohemian Grove is not documented; his cultivation of Grove members is documented #claim

## Baal / Ancient Religious Symbolism — Research Context

### What's in the Record

**Documented**:
- Bohemian Grove ceremony uses theatrical Canaanite/ancient Near Eastern imagery (the owl deity, sacrifice of "Care")
- The "Cremation of Care" is explicitly theatrical but draws on ancient religious symbolism
- Epstein's properties featured unusual artwork and statuary that multiple journalists noted

**Documented — Artwork at Properties**:
- A large portrait of Bill Clinton in a blue dress (women's clothing) was documented at the NYC townhouse — viewed by multiple witnesses, reported by NYT
- Other unusual artwork documented by FBI search inventory
- Custom chess set reportedly depicted sexual themes (reported by witnesses) #claim
- Epstein's library reportedly contained books on occult and esoteric subjects #claim

**Alleged / Speculative (#claim)**:
- Direct Baal/Moloch worship by Epstein or his network: no documentation
- King Solomon's Temple imagery in Little Saint James "temple" design: architectural parallel noted by some analysts, not confirmed as intentional
- Satanic ritual abuse: no documentation in any court record or official investigation
