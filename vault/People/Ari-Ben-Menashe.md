## Robert Maxwell Testimony — Key Source

- In *Profits of War* (1992), Ben-Menashe stated:
  - Robert Maxwell was recruited as a Mossad asset in the 1960s
  - Maxwell passed intelligence and ran operations for Israel through his media empire
  - Maxwell was involved in the distribution of the compromised PROMIS software
  - Maxwell's Israeli state funeral confirmed his intelligence significance

### Corroboration
- Gordon Thomas and Martin Dillon (*Robert Maxwell: Israel's Superspy*, 2002) independently corroborated many Ben-Menashe claims through separate sourcing
- Seymour Hersh's work also references Maxwell's intelligence role
- The Israeli state funeral — with six intelligence chiefs attending — is an objective fact that corroborates the general thesis

### Controversies
- Ben-Menashe was arrested in the US in 1989 on arms trafficking charges; acquitted
- Some intelligence analysts question the completeness of his account
- His credibility has been attacked by those whose interests are threatened by his claims
