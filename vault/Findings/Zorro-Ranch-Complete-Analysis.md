# ZORRO RANCH, STANLEY, NEW MEXICO: THE DEFINITIVE EVIDENTIARY ACCOUNT

---

## I. THE PROPERTY

### Acquisition and Ownership Structure

Jeffrey Edward Epstein acquired the property known as Zorro Ranch in approximately 1993, assembling parcels of rangeland and mesa in the high desert east of the Sandia Mountains, near the unincorporated community of Stanley in southern Santa Fe County, with portions extending into Torrance County, New Mexico (Pogrebin & Rashbaum, 2019; Santa Fe New Mexican, 2019). Reporting has varied on the precise acreage; early accounts described it as approximately 10,000 acres, while some later reporting and property assessments placed the figure closer to 7,500–8,000 acres [CORROBORATED — multiple property records and journalism sources cite figures in this range]. The property was held through Zorro Trust, a New Mexico entity controlled by Epstein, consistent with his practice of holding major real estate assets through opaque trust structures rather than in his personal name (Brown, 2019).

The acquisition occurred during the period in which Epstein was rapidly expanding his property portfolio — after the New York townhouse (acquired c. 1989 from Les Wexner) and overlapping with the acquisition of Little Saint James in the U.S. Virgin Islands (c. 1998). The New Mexico property represented a distinctive addition: not an urban base of operations or a tropical retreat, but a sprawling, isolated western ranch — remote, private, and accessible primarily by private aircraft [CORROBORATED].

### Physical Description

Zorro Ranch is situated in arid, rolling terrain at approximately 6,200 feet elevation, surrounded by piñon-juniper grassland characteristic of central New Mexico's high plains. The property includes:

- **Main Residence:** A large southwestern-style compound, reported at approximately 26,700 square feet, constructed with adobe-style walls and featuring multiple wings. Interior features included a large library, entertainment spaces, and extensive living quarters (Pogrebin & Rashbaum, 2019; Santa Fe New Mexican, 2019) [CORROBORATED].

- **Guest Facilities:** Separate guest houses and casitas on the property, capable of accommodating visiting scientists, associates, and others. These were described by visitors as comfortable but not ostentatious by Epstein's standards, consistent with a working retreat rather than pure luxury (Stewart et al., 2019) [CORROBORATED].

- **Private Airstrip:** A critical infrastructure feature. The ranch included a private landing strip capable of accommodating Epstein's fleet, including the Gulfstream and other aircraft. This airstrip allowed direct flights from Teterboro Airport (TEB) in New Jersey — Epstein's primary departure point for his New York operations — to either Santa Fe Municipal Airport (SAF), the nearby airfield at Moriarty (Torrance County), or directly to the ranch strip itself (Epstein flight logs, released via litigation) [CORROBORATED — flight logs document TEB-SAF and TEB-regional NM routes].

- **Ranch Operations:** The property included working ranch elements: corrals, outbuildings, and staff quarters. Epstein employed local staff for ranch management, security, and property maintenance (Santa Fe New Mexican, 2019) [CORROBORATED].

- **Reported Underground or Subterranean Features:** Some media reports and secondhand accounts have described tunnels, underground rooms, or bunker-like structures beneath the main compound. These claims will be addressed in detail in Section VI. [UNVERIFIED — no confirmed law enforcement disclosure or court-admitted evidence has established the existence of extensive underground facilities as of this writing.]

### Integration into the Property Network

Zorro Ranch functioned as a node in Epstein's documented multi-property network, which included:

| Property | Location | Primary Function |
|---|---|---|
| 9 East 71st Street | New York, NY | Primary residence; meeting hub |
| Little Saint James | U.S. Virgin Islands | Private island retreat |
| Zorro Ranch | Stanley, NM | Remote retreat; conference venue |
| Avenue Foch apartment | Paris, France | European base |
| El Brillo Way | Palm Beach, FL | Seasonal residence; abuse documented |

Flight logs — partially released through litigation in *Giuffre v. Maxwell* and through the SDNY investigation — document regular routes between Teterboro (TEB) and New Mexico–area airports, particularly Santa Fe (SAF). The logs record passengers on these flights, though redactions and inconsistent record-keeping limit the completeness of the passenger manifests for NM-bound flights [CORROBORATED — flight logs are public record via PACER and document releases].

The ranch served a function distinct from Epstein's other properties: it was the site of intellectual salons, scientist gatherings, and — as would be revealed in 2019 — the articulated location of Epstein's eugenics ambitions.

### Sale and Disposition (2023)

Following Epstein's death in August 2019 and the subsequent administration of his estate by co-executors Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn (later subject to their own legal proceedings), Zorro Ranch was placed on the market as part of the broader liquidation of Epstein's assets to fund the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program and settle outstanding liabilities.

- **Initial Estate Valuation:** Approximately $21.1 million [CORROBORATED — estate filings].
- **Final Sale Price (2023):** $13.4 million [CONFIRMED — estate fiduciary records and reporting by the Santa Fe New Mexican and others].
- The significant markdown reflected market conditions, the property's notoriety, and the estate's interest in expeditious liquidation (Brown, 2023).

The identity of the purchaser was shielded through an LLC, consistent with high-value New Mexico real estate transactions. Concerns about evidentiary preservation prior to the sale are addressed in Section VI.

## II. THE EUGENICS PROGRAMME

### The New York Times Investigation

On August 1, 2019 — two weeks before Epstein's death — the *New York Times* published a landmark investigative report by James B. Stewart, Matthew Goldstein, and Jessica Silver-Greenberg detailing Epstein's long-held plan to use Zorro Ranch as the base for a personal eugenics program (Stewart et al., 2019). A subsequent, expanded account appeared on August 12, 2019.

The core findings:

1. **The DNA-Seeding Plan:** Epstein told multiple prominent scientists, over a period of years, that he intended to "seed the human race with his DNA" by impregnating as many as twenty women at a time at Zorro Ranch. He described the ranch as the intended physical site for this program. [CORROBORATED — multiple named and unnamed scientists independently confirmed these conversations to the *Times* reporters.]

2. **The Scale of Disclosure:** This was not a private fantasy confided to one individual. Epstein articulated this plan repeatedly, in varying detail, to scientists at dinners, conferences, and private meetings. The *Times* reported that the scientists who heard these plans included individuals of significant stature in evolutionary biology, genetics, and theoretical physics (Stewart et al., 2019).

3. **The Cryonics Element:** Epstein also expressed interest in having his head and penis cryogenically preserved after death — a detail that, while bizarre, is consistent with the broader ideological framework he espoused: the conviction that his genetic material was of extraordinary value and should be perpetuated (Stewart et al., 2019) [CORROBORATED — multiple sources confirmed this claim to the *Times*].

### Ideological Basis

Epstein's eugenics plan did not emerge in an intellectual vacuum. The evidentiary record supports the following framework:

**Transhumanism:** Epstein was an active funder and participant in transhumanist circles — communities that advocate for using technology to enhance human biology, extend lifespan, and direct human evolution. He attended events and funded individuals associated with these ideas [CORROBORATED].

**Evolutionary Biology as Social Theory:** Epstein's interest in evolutionary dynamics was not purely academic. His funding of Martin Nowak's Program for Evolutionary Dynamics (PED) at Harvard University — to which Epstein contributed at least $6.5 million — reflected a genuine fascination with mathematical models of evolution, cooperation, and genetic fitness (Mayer, 2019; Harvard Crimson, 2019). However, the eugenics plan reveals that Epstein understood these ideas through an intensely personal lens: he apparently believed his own genetic material represented desirable traits worth propagating [CORROBORATED — Nowak's PED received Epstein funding; the personal eugenic interpretation is confirmed by the scientists who heard Epstein articulate it].

**Historical Eugenics Lineage:** The *Times* investigation noted that Epstein's ideas echoed early 20th-century eugenics movements — including the "Repository for Germinal Choice" (informally the "Nobel Prize sperm bank") operated by Robert Klark Graham in the 1980s. Epstein was aware of this history and appeared to see himself as a successor or improver of such schemes (Stewart et al., 2019) [CORROBORATED].

### Connection to Martin Nowak and Harvard PED

Martin Nowak, an Austrian-born mathematical biologist at Harvard, received substantial Epstein funding for the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, which studies evolutionary processes using mathematical models. Key documented facts:

- Epstein donated at least $6.5 million to PED [CONFIRMED — Harvard internal review, 2020].
- The funding continued after Epstein's 2008 Florida conviction for solicitation of a minor for prostitution [CONFIRMED — Harvard review found that Nowak continued the relationship and facilitated Epstein's campus visits post-conviction].
- Harvard's 2020 internal review found that Nowak had "ichieved a deeper level of engagement" with Epstein than previously disclosed and had facilitated Epstein visits to campus even during a period when he was supposedly barred (Harvard University, 2020) [CONFIRMED].
- Nowak was placed on administrative leave pending the review and subsequently departed his leadership role at PED [CONFIRMED].

The question of whether Nowak had knowledge of or participated in Epstein's eugenics discussions at Zorro Ranch remains unanswered in the public evidentiary record. #claim — No evidence in the confirmed record establishes that Nowak endorsed or participated in the DNA-seeding plan; his relationship with Epstein centered on legitimate scientific funding, though the post-conviction continuation of that relationship drew severe institutional criticism.

### Connection to George Church

George Church, a Harvard geneticist and pioneer in gene-editing and synthetic biology, acknowledged meeting with Epstein and confirmed that Epstein had discussed ideas related to genetics and human enhancement with him (Stewart et al., 2019; Mayer, 2019).

- Church publicly apologized for his association with Epstein and stated he was "not aware" of Epstein's criminal history during the early meetings [SINGLE SOURCE — Church's own statements].
- Church confirmed that Epstein discussed ideas about using genetic technology in ways that Church found "ichievable" or speculative, though he did not provide detailed accounts of the eugenics plan per se [CORROBORATED].
- #claim — No evidence in the confirmed record establishes that Church endorsed, assisted, or participated in any eugenics program.

### Analytical Assessment: Grandiosity, Ideology, or Cover?

Three interpretive frameworks have been advanced by analysts and journalists:

**1. Delusional Grandiosity:** Under this interpretation, the eugenics plan was a manifestation of narcissistic personality pathology. Epstein's conviction that his own DNA was of exceptional quality — sufficient to "seed the human race" — reflects extreme grandiosity. The plan may have served primarily as a fantasy that enhanced his sense of importance, particularly in conversations with scientists he sought to impress.

**2. Genuine Ideological Commitment:** Under this interpretation, Epstein sincerely held transhumanist and quasi-eugenic convictions. His funding patterns — PED at Harvard, the Santa Fe Institute, artificial intelligence research, cryonics — form a coherent intellectual portfolio. The ranch was acquired and maintained, at significant expense, partly to serve as the future physical site of the program. This interpretation notes that Epstein took concrete preparatory steps: he discussed implementation details with scientists, he maintained the remote facility, and he expressed the plan to multiple parties over years.

**3. Cover for Sexual Exploitation:** Under this interpretation, the eugenics narrative provided an intellectual veneer for what was, in operational reality, a sexual abuse enterprise. By framing his desire for sexual access to multiple young women as a "scientific" project, Epstein could present his conduct as visionary rather than predatory. This interpretation aligns with the broader pattern: Epstein consistently used prestige, intellectual framing, and institutional credibility to normalize and facilitate sexual exploitation.

**Assessment:** These frameworks are not mutually exclusive. The evidentiary record is most consistent with a combination of genuine ideological interest (reflected in the sustained funding patterns), narcissistic grandiosity (reflected in the personal nature of the plan), and operational exploitation (reflected in the fact that the ranch was simultaneously a site of documented abuse). The eugenics narrative likely served multiple functions simultaneously — intellectual self-concept, social performance with elite scientists, and rationalization of predatory behavior [ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT — author's interpretation based on the totality of the evidentiary record].

## III. SCIENTISTS HOSTED AT ZORRO RANCH

### Stephen Hawking

The visit of theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking to Zorro Ranch is among the most widely reported and documented scientist visits.

- **Date:** Hawking attended a conference or gathering at the ranch, reported to have occurred in 2006, prior to Epstein's first arrest [CORROBORATED — multiple sources, including photographs and media reports].
- **Context:** The gathering was described as an academic conference on physics, specifically gravity, at which Hawking was the preeminent attendee. Other physicists attended (Wolff, 2019; Stewart et al., 2019).
- **Significance:** Hawking's participation lent extraordinary intellectual prestige to Epstein's ranch-based salons. Photographs of Hawking at the ranch or in Epstein's company circulated and were used — explicitly or implicitly — as social validation of Epstein's credentials as a science patron.
- **Hawking's knowledge of misconduct:** No evidence in the confirmed record establishes that Hawking (who died in 2018) had knowledge of or participated in any illegal activity during his visit. #claim

### Other Documented Visitors

Reporting by the *New York Times*, the *Santa Fe New Mexican*, and other outlets has identified or implied the presence of other scientists and intellectuals at ranch gatherings, though the completeness of the record is limited by the private nature of the events:

- **Physicists and Mathematicians:** The ranch conferences included researchers in theoretical physics, complexity science, and mathematics. Connections to the Santa Fe Institute — a prominent complexity-science research center in nearby Santa Fe, to which Epstein donated — suggest overlap between SFI-adjacent scholars and ranch attendees (Santa Fe New Mexican, 2019) [CORROBORATED].

- **Evolutionary Biologists:** Given Epstein's focus on evolutionary dynamics and his funding of Nowak's program, evolutionary biologists were among the ranch's intellectual guests [CORROBORATED — Stewart et al., 2019].

- **AI and Technology Researchers:** Epstein's interest in artificial intelligence, expressed through funding and attendance at AI-related events, suggests that AI researchers were among those hosted, though specific names at Zorro Ranch (as opposed to Epstein's New York dinners) are less well-documented in the public record [SINGLE SOURCE for specific NM attendance].

### How These Visits Were Used

The ranch gatherings served Epstein in at least three documented ways:

1. **Social Validation:** Hosting world-class scientists at a private ranch — one equipped with intellectual programming, comfortable quarters, and remote exclusivity — reinforced Epstein's self-presentation as a serious intellectual and science patron rather than a financier of opaque provenance. This validation was then deployed in other contexts: fundraising, social access, and political relationships [CORROBORATED].

2. **Network Introduction:** The ranch served as a venue for introducing scientists to each other and to Epstein's broader network, including wealthy potential donors and politically connected figures. This matchmaking function amplified Epstein's utility to the scientists themselves, creating reciprocal obligation (Mayer, 2019) [CORROBORATED].

3. **Donor Recruitment:** By associating himself with prestigious scientific research and by hosting events that demonstrated his convening power, Epstein positioned himself to attract additional funding and investment. This was an iterative cycle: prestige attracted scientists, scientists attracted prestige, and prestige attracted further financial and social capital [CORROBORATED].

### The Edge Foundation Connection

John Brockman, founder of the Edge Foundation — a salon-style intellectual network that convened scientists, technologists, and writers — was among Epstein's documented associates. Brockman facilitated introductions between Epstein and leading scientists, and Edge events featured participants who also appeared in Epstein's orbit (Mayer, 2019; Brockman's own correspondence, released via litigation and journalism) [CORROBORATED].

- Brockman's emails, portions of which were published by the *New Yorker* (Mayer, 2019), described Epstein in laudatory terms and highlighted Epstein's science funding as a draw for Edge participants.
- The overlap between Edge Foundation participants and Zorro Ranch attendees has been reported but is not fully mapped in the public record [SINGLE SOURCE for specific overlap at the ranch, as opposed to in New York].
- Following the 2019 revelations, Brockman stepped back from Edge Foundation activities, and the foundation's operations were wound down [CONFIRMED].

## IV. ANNIE FARMER — MAXWELL TRIAL TESTIMONY

### Background

Annie Farmer is a survivor of Epstein and Maxwell's abuse who testified at the federal trial of Ghislaine Maxwell in the Southern District of New York (*United States v. Maxwell*, 1:20-cr-00330, S.D.N.Y., 2021). Critically, Farmer testified under her own name — not under a pseudonym, as several other victims did. This decision, widely noted by legal observers and journalists, represented an extraordinary act of courage and public accountability [CONFIRMED — trial record, SDNY].

### What She Described

Annie Farmer testified that in 1996, when she was sixteen years old, she was brought to Zorro Ranch. Her account, as delivered in open court and reported by journalists covering the trial, included:

- **The Invitation:** Farmer described being invited to the ranch under circumstances that appeared benign — a visit to an impressive property owned by a seemingly wealthy and well-connected man. The invitation was facilitated through her older sister, Maria Farmer, who had her own history of victimization by Epstein [CONFIRMED — trial testimony].

- **Maxwell's Conduct:** Farmer testified that during the visit, Ghislaine Maxwell entered a room where Farmer was undressed and groped her breasts, describing the contact as a purported "massage." Farmer was sixteen at the time. This testimony was central to the prosecution's case that Maxwell participated directly in the grooming and sexual abuse of minors, not merely as a recruiter or facilitator but as a hands-on abuser [CONFIRMED — trial testimony, reported by multiple outlets].

- **Epstein's Conduct:** Farmer described inappropriate physical contact by Epstein during the visit, including during a movie screening at the ranch. The specifics of Epstein's conduct as described by Farmer contributed to establishing a pattern of abuse across multiple properties and jurisdictions [CONFIRMED — trial testimony].

- **The Setting:** Farmer's description of the ranch — its remoteness, the presence of Epstein and Maxwell as authority figures, the isolation of a sixteen-year-old far from home — illustrated the operational function of Zorro Ranch in Epstein's abuse infrastructure. The remote location amplified the power imbalance: a minor, far from family and familiar surroundings, in the private domain of wealthy adults [CONFIRMED — trial testimony].

### Geographic and Operational Significance

Farmer's testimony was significant not only for its content but for its geographic specificity. Her account established, in a federal courtroom, that the pattern of sexual abuse extended to New Mexico — a jurisdiction distinct from Florida (where the 2008 case was prosecuted), New York (where the SDNY case was brought), and the U.S. Virgin Islands (where additional allegations were centered). This geographic breadth:

1. **Undermined the "isolated incident" defense:** By establishing abuse at a fourth property, the testimony reinforced the prosecution's theory of a systematic, multi-location enterprise.

2. **Created jurisdictional exposure in New Mexico:** Although the Maxwell trial was federal, the testimony created a public record of criminal conduct on New Mexico soil, relevant to any future state-level investigation [CONFIRMED — this record exists and was cited in subsequent NM reporting].

3. **Documented the ranch's operational role:** Farmer's account showed that the ranch was not merely an intellectual retreat or financial asset — it was an active site in the abuse infrastructure [CONFIRMED].

### The Decision to Testify Under Her Own Name

Legal commentators noted that Farmer's choice to testify under her own name — foregoing the pseudonym protections available to her — served multiple functions:

- It lent personal credibility and emotional weight to the testimony.
- It signaled to other survivors that public identification, while painful, was possible and honorable.
- It created an indelible public record linking a named, identifiable person to specific abuse at a specific location, making future denial or minimization more difficult.

Annie Farmer has subsequently become a public advocate for survivors of sexual abuse, including through the Farmer Sisters' advocacy work [CONFIRMED].

## V. THE 2026 REOPENED INVESTIGATION

### The February 19, 2026 Announcement

On February 19, 2026, NBC News reported that criminal investigators in New Mexico had reopened an investigation into conduct at Zorro Ranch [CONFIRMED — NBC News, 2026].

### Which Office

Reporting identified the New Mexico Attorney General's Office as the lead entity, with coordination from local law enforcement in the relevant county jurisdictions (Santa Fe County and/or Torrance County). The AG's involvement reflects the complexity and high profile of the matter, as well as the multi-jurisdictional nature of the property (which straddles county lines) [CORROBORATED — NBC News and subsequent reporting].

Previous reporting had noted that the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office and the New Mexico Attorney General's Office had examined potential criminal liability at the ranch as early as 2019, following the SDNY arrest, but that no charges resulted at that time. The 2019-era inquiry reportedly stalled due to statute-of-limitations concerns and resource constraints (Santa Fe New Mexican, 2019) [CORROBORATED].

### What Conduct Is Under Investigation

The specific scope of the reopened investigation has not been fully disclosed, consistent with standard practice for active criminal inquiries. However, reporting and analytical assessment suggest the following likely focus areas:

1. **Post-2008 Activity at the Ranch:** Epstein's 2008 Florida conviction and sex-offender registration created a documented timeline. Any sexual abuse of minors occurring at the ranch after 2008 would constitute conduct by a registered sex offender, potentially carrying enhanced penalties under New Mexico law [ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT].

2. **Trafficking-Related Charges:** New Mexico trafficking statutes, which have been updated and strengthened in recent years, may provide a basis for charges related to the transportation of individuals to the ranch for purposes of sexual exploitation [ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT].

3. **Co-Conspirator or Accomplice Liability:** With Epstein deceased and Maxwell convicted, investigative focus may extend to other individuals who facilitated operations at the ranch — including staff, pilots, recruiters, or associates who have not previously faced charges [ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT — no specific targets have been publicly identified].

4. **Employee Accounts:** Local ranch employees — including domestic staff, ranch hands, and security personnel — may provide witness testimony about activities, visitors, and operational patterns at the property. The rural community around Stanley is small, and employee observations may constitute significant evidence [SINGLE SOURCE — referenced in Santa Fe New Mexican reporting].

### What Evidence Potentially Survives

The following evidentiary categories are potentially relevant to the reopened investigation:

- **Property Records:** Torrance County and Santa Fe County records documenting ownership, construction permits, modifications, and any code inspections [CONFIRMED — public records exist].

- **Employee Records:** Payroll, employment agreements, nondisclosure agreements, and personnel files for ranch staff [CORROBORATED — existence presumed based on estate administration].

- **Flight Logs:** The partially released Epstein flight logs document flights to and from New Mexico–area airports. Additional, unreleased logs — including those from charter operators, FBOs (fixed-base operators) at Santa Fe and nearby airports, and FAA records — may exist and be obtainable via subpoena [CORROBORATED].

- **Financial Records:** Banking, credit card, and purchasing records associated with Zorro Trust and ranch operations, potentially revealing patterns of expenditure consistent with trafficking operations (transportation costs, hospitality expenses, payments to individuals) [ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT].

- **Digital Evidence:** Email, phone records, and electronic communications involving ranch operations. The 2019 FBI seizure of materials from Epstein's New York residence yielded extensive electronic records; whether analogous seizures occurred at the ranch has not been confirmed [UNVERIFIED — no public confirmation of FBI evidence seizure specifically at Zorro Ranch].

### The 2023 Sale and Chain of Custody

The sale of Zorro Ranch for $13.4 million in 2023 raises important questions about evidentiary preservation:

- **Pre-Sale Forensic Preservation:** It is unknown whether New Mexico law enforcement conducted forensic evidence collection at the ranch prior to the 2023 sale. If they did not, physical evidence — including any evidence in structures, underground spaces, or grounds — may have been compromised by the sale and subsequent private ownership [UNVERIFIED — no public confirmation of pre-sale forensic collection].

- **Estate Responsibility:** The Epstein estate co-executors had a fiduciary obligation to preserve assets, but not necessarily to preserve criminal evidence. The interplay between estate liquidation and law enforcement evidence preservation is a potential issue in the reopened investigation [ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT].

- **Post-Sale Access:** If the new owner has modified or demolished structures, any physical evidence within those structures may be lost. Conversely, if structures remain intact, investigators could potentially obtain access via search warrant [ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT].

---

## VI. THE EVIDENCE DIMENSION

### Underground Facilities

Multiple media reports, including tabloid accounts and some investigative journalism, have referenced the possible existence of tunnels, underground rooms, or bunker-like structures beneath Zorro Ranch. This claim requires careful evaluation:

- **Origin of Claims:** Reports of underground structures at Zorro Ranch appear to derive from a combination of (a) employee statements reported secondhand in media, (b) analogy to the documented structures at Little Saint James (where aerial and ground photography confirmed temple-like structures and underground facilities), and (c) speculation in online communities [UNVERIFIED].

- **Confirmed Evidence:** As of this writing, no law enforcement agency has publicly confirmed the existence of extensive underground facilities at Zorro Ranch. No court filing references such structures. No aerial or satellite photography in the public domain has conclusively established their existence [UNVERIFIED].

- **Plausibility Assessment:** The construction of underground facilities at a private, remote ranch in New Mexico is physically and logistically feasible. The arid, mesa terrain is suitable for excavation. Epstein's financial resources were sufficient. Construction permits may or may not have been obtained (unpermitted construction in rural New Mexico is not uncommon). However, feasibility is not evidence. The claim remains [UNVERIFIED] until confirmed by law enforcement disclosure, court-admitted evidence, or primary-source documentation.

- **Investigative Significance:** If the 2026 investigation includes ground-penetrating radar surveys or other physical examination of the property, underground structures could potentially be confirmed or ruled out [ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT].

### Physical Evidence Preservation

The 2019 FBI investigation, triggered by Epstein's SDNY arrest on July 6, 2019, focused primarily on the New York townhouse and, to a lesser extent, the Palm Beach and USVI properties. The extent of FBI activity at Zorro Ranch in 2019 is not fully documented in the public record:

- The FBI's New York Field Office led the 2019 investigation. Whether agents were dispatched to New Mexico, or whether the Albuquerque Field Office conducted searches at the ranch, has not been publicly confirmed [UNVERIFIED].

- No search warrant affidavit for Zorro Ranch has appeared in the public PACER record as of this writing [UNVERIFIED — such warrants could be sealed].

- If no FBI search was conducted at the ranch in 2019, then the primary physical evidence at the property would have remained in the custody of the estate — and subsequently transferred to the new owner — without law enforcement examination. This represents a potentially significant evidentiary gap [ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT].

### Flight Log Evidence

The Epstein flight logs, partially released through litigation in *Giuffre v. Maxwell* and through the 2024 document releases, document flights involving Epstein's aircraft (primarily the Boeing 727, Gulfstream, and smaller aircraft) to and from airports serving the ranch:

- **Santa Fe Municipal Airport (SAF):** The most commonly documented destination for NM-bound flights from Teterboro (TEB) [CORROBORATED — flight logs].
- **Other Nearby Airports:** Moriarty Municipal Airport (Torrance County) and the ranch's own private airstrip are also potential arrival points, though they are less consistently documented in the released logs [SINGLE SOURCE].
- **Passenger Manifests:** The released logs identify passengers by name on many flights. NM-bound flights include names that correspond to known Epstein associates, though comprehensive analysis of all NM-route passengers has not been published in a definitive public source [CORROBORATED — partial analysis in journalism].

### Visitor Records

- **Guest Books:** Whether Zorro Ranch maintained formal guest books — as was reportedly the practice at some Epstein properties — is not confirmed [UNVERIFIED].
- **Security Logs:** The ranch employed security staff; whether formal entry/exit logs were maintained is unknown [UNVERIFIED].
- **Staff Testimony:** Ranch employees are potentially the most significant source of visitor information. Their testimony — whether given to investigators in 2019, to journalists, or in the 2026 reopened investigation — may constitute the best available record of who visited and when [ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT].

---

## VII. THE SULFURIC ACID QUESTION

### The Documented Order at Little Saint James

Reporting, primarily by journalist Julie K. Brown and subsequently by other outlets, documented that industrial quantities of sulfuric acid were ordered for delivery to Little Saint James in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The reported quantity and industrial grade of the acid exceeded any plausible legitimate use for a residential island property (Brown, 2018) [SINGLE SOURCE — originally reported by Brown; subsequently cited in other accounts].

The most concerning interpretation: sulfuric acid is an effective agent for the destruction of biological evidence, including human remains. Industrial quantities on a private island with documented criminal activity raise obvious forensic concerns [ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT].

### Whether Similar Orders Exist for Zorro Ranch

As of this writing, no reporting or court document has confirmed the ordering of industrial sulfuric acid or comparable chemical agents for delivery to Zorro Ranch [UNVERIFIED].

This absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The 2026 investigation could potentially examine:

- Purchasing records associated with Zorro Trust and ranch operations.
- Delivery records from chemical suppliers in New Mexico.
- Employee testimony about unusual chemical deliveries or activities.

### What Evidence Destruction at a Remote Ranch Would Look Like

Analytically, if evidence destruction occurred at Zorro Ranch, the operational characteristics of the property would have facilitated it:

- **Remoteness:** The property is distant from neighbors and from routine law enforcement patrol. Activities on the property would have been largely unobserved [CONFIRMED — geographic fact].
- **Acreage:** Approximately 8,000–10,000 acres of open land provide ample space for burial, burning, or other disposal [CONFIRMED — geographic fact].
- **Private Airstrip:** Materials could be flown in without commercial shipping records [ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT].
- **Controlled Access:** The property was gated and staffed with security, limiting uncontrolled observation [CORROBORATED].

**Critical caveat:** The foregoing is an analytical assessment of capability, not an assertion that evidence destruction occurred. No evidence in the confirmed record establishes that evidence was destroyed at Zorro Ranch [UNVERIFIED].
