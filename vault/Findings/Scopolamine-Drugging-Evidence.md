# Scopolamine / Drugging — Documented DOJ File Evidence

> **Sourced directly from released DOJ files.** Epstein's emails about scopolamine are documented in file EFTA00008744, publicly available at justice.gov/epstein. The link between this knowledge and actual use on victims is not established in current court record — but the documented interest and a victim impact statement are recorded here.

## What the DOJ Files Document (Public Record)

### Epstein Emails — Scopolamine (File EFTA00008744)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| DOJ file ref | EFTA00008744 — publicly available at justice.gov/epstein |
| Content | Emails referencing scopolamine ("Devil's Breath") and "trumpet plants" |
| Dates | 2014–2015 |
| Subject line forwarded to Epstein | "Scopolamine: Powerful drug growing in the forests of Colombia that ELIMINATES free will" |

**What scopolamine is:**
- Tropane alkaloid produced by plants including Brugmansia ("trumpet plants" / "angel's trumpet")
- Known effects: sedation, suggestibility, memory impairment, lowered inhibition
- Known as "Devil's Breath" / "zombie drug" in street contexts
- Reportedly does not appear on standard toxicology screens

**What the files show:**
- Epstein was forwarded and apparently engaged with articles specifically about scopolamine's free-will-eliminating properties
- Epstein's island and properties had nurseries; emails reference "trumpet plants" — the primary botanical source of scopolamine

## Victim Impact Statement — Drugging Allegation

Per a 2022 victim impact statement submitted in the case (Joseph Manzaro):
- Describes an incident from December 2014
- Alleges being drugged; states he overheard: "I gave him a LOT of that scopolamine"
- Describes subsequent memory loss and extreme drowsiness

> This is an allegation in a victim statement, not a proven fact. It is documented here as a filed allegation.

## Connection to Maxwell Trial — Drugging Testimony

In the Maxwell trial (SDNY 20-CR-330), victim "Carolyn" testified that:
- She was given "different drinks" at Epstein's properties that made her feel "loopy" or impaired
- Maxwell and Epstein used alcohol and substances to lower victims' inhibitions
- Specific substances were not confirmed by forensic evidence in the trial record

## MKUltra Context Note

The user has asked about a possible MKUltra connection. For accuracy:

- **MKUltra** was a real CIA program (1953–1973) that researched mind-control drugs including scopolamine, LSD, and other substances
- MKUltra was officially ended in 1973; relevant documents partially destroyed; remainder released via FOIA in 1977
- **No court document** in the Epstein case connects Epstein's interest in scopolamine to an active intelligence program
- Kiriakou and others have suggested Epstein had intelligence connections (see [[Findings/Intelligence-Connections]])
- The documented overlap: (1) MKUltra researched scopolamine as a mind-control/interrogation drug; (2) Epstein had documented interest in scopolamine's "free will eliminating" properties; (3) Epstein alleged to have had intelligence connections
- **This is a documented overlap of interests, not a confirmed operational link**
