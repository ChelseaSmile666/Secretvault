## Connection to Epstein — Core Facts (Public Record)

### Power of Attorney (1991)

This is the foundational documented link:

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Date granted | July 1991 |
| Scope | "Unlimited" — sign cheques, hire staff, borrow money, buy/sell property |
| Effect | Epstein effectively became shadow manager of Wexner's entire fortune |
| Significance | This is how Epstein gained access to wealth, properties, and connections |

### The NYC Townhouse ([[Locations/9-East-71st-Street-NYC]])
- Wexner purchased 9 East 71st Street, NYC in 1989
- Transferred/gifted the property to Epstein in the early 1990s
- Property became Epstein's primary NYC base; searched by FBI in 2019

### Epstein's Financial Role
- Wexner was Epstein's primary (possibly only) known major client at J. Epstein & Co. / Financial Trust Co.
- Wexner's attorneys told investigators in 2008 that Epstein had misappropriated funds; Epstein repaid ~$100 million (per investigative memo in 2026 DOJ release) — thought to be partial repayment

### Victoria's Secret / Model Pipeline Allegation
- Epstein used business cards identifying himself as a Victoria's Secret talent scout (#claim — documented in Palm Beach PD investigation and civil filings)
- Alleged recruitment pipeline: Epstein told potential victims he could connect them to Victoria's Secret (#claim)
