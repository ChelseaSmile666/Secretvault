> **Fully documented.** Epstein donated $9.1M+ to Harvard and $7.5M+ to MIT, purchasing access to elite scientists and intellectual credibility. This is documented in independent institutional reviews.

|-------------|--------|------------------|--------|
| Harvard University | $6.5M (Program for Evolutionary Dynamics) | Martin Nowak | Spent; not returned |

## Harvard — Detailed

### Program for Evolutionary Dynamics (PED)
- Epstein's signature Harvard investment: $6.5 million to the **Program for Evolutionary Dynamics**
- PED director Martin Nowak was a close associate who flew on Epstein's plane
- PED research: evolutionary game theory, evolutionary computation — directly aligned with Epstein's eugenics interests (see [[Findings/AI-Transhumanism-Epstein]])
- Nowak maintained relationship with Epstein post-2008 conviction

### Harvard's Failure to Act
- Harvard received donations from Epstein **post-2008** conviction — while he was a registered sex offender
- Harvard's review of donations (post-2019) found the university had failed to act on prior concerns
- Harvard President Lawrence Bacow announced (2019) the university would give equivalent of Epstein donations to charitable organisations — did not directly return funds
- Harvard established task force on "ethical gift processes" post-Epstein

### The Legitimisation Function
- Epstein used Harvard affiliation to claim scientific credentials he did not have
- Business cards listed him as affiliated with Harvard
- The PED gave him intellectual access and cover for his transhumanist agenda
- See [[People/Larry-Summers]] — Harvard President during peak donation period

## MIT — Detailed (Most Documented Case)

### The Concealment (Documented — Internal Emails)
- [[People/Joi-Ito]] and MIT Media Lab staff **deliberately concealed** Epstein's identity from MIT gift records
- Epstein labeled "anonymous" in formal gift records despite being the known donor
- Internal emails (leaked to New Yorker's Ronan Farrow) show explicit instructions to hide Epstein's name:
  - "we're keeping his name out of things" — Ito
  - Staff directed to describe him as "a friend of a friend" when explaining funding source
- Nicholas Negroponte (MIT Media Lab founder) facilitated early Epstein connection

### The New Yorker Investigation (September 2019)
- Ronan Farrow & Jill Lepore: "How an Élite University Research Center Concealed Its Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein"
- Published September 6, 2019 — triggered immediate MIT institutional response
- Revealed: Ito had personally visited Epstein in prison (2013); had accepted Epstein donations since 2013

### MIT's Response
- MIT President Rafael Reif issued formal apology (September 2019)
- MIT retained Goodwin Procter LLP for independent investigation
- Goodwin Procter report found systemic failures; released November 2019
- Ito resigned from all boards; MIT restructured oversight of gifts

## Why Scientists Accepted the Money

- Epstein donated to areas of genuine scientific interest
- He presented as an intellectually engaged patron
- Many scientists did not know full details of his 2008 conviction
- Some who did know continued accepting — institutional pressure and financial incentive
- Post-2019: mass exodus of acknowledgment and expressions of regret
