# Missing Evidence & Investigative Gaps

> What we know is missing — documented gaps in evidence, unexplored leads, and withheld files.

---

## MCC Camera Footage — Confirmed Missing

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Camera outside Epstein cell on death night | Footage not recovered; hardware failure confirmed |
| Second camera in area | Also failed same night |
| Footage gap | Approximately 3 hours of missing monitoring records |
| Investigation | DOJ IG confirmed failure; cause not resolved |

- See [[Findings/Cover-Up-MCC-Death-Evidence]] for full documentation
- Whether failure was technical or deliberate: **not established**

## The Storage Unit — Documented Reference, Unreported Search

- Epstein communications (referenced in multiple post-2019 journalism accounts) indicate the existence of a **storage unit** containing materials
- **FBI reportedly did not search** the storage unit referenced in communications #claim
- Whether this storage unit has since been identified, searched, or its contents documented is not in public record
- This gap has been cited by Epstein family and attorneys as a concern
- **Open research question: location, contents, search status**

## DOJ Files — Withheld and Redacted Material

### The 3.5 Million Page Release (2026)
- The January 2026 DOJ release ([[Findings/2026-DOJ-Epstein-Files-Release]]) comprises 3.5M pages
- However, congressional investigation opened into **specifically withheld files related to Trump allegations** (bipartisan)
- NPR reported DOJ removed/withheld files related to accusations against Trump — files appear in directory but content missing
- Attorneys criticised "ham-fisted" redactions — same name exposed in one copy, redacted in another
- DOJ accused of "hiding perpetrators while exposing survivors"

### Pre-2026 Sealed Documents
- Multiple court orders sealed specific Epstein-related filings
- Some remain sealed; parties have not successfully moved to unseal all material
- SDNY 19-CR-490 — some exhibits remain under seal

### FBI Files
- FBI investigation files from 2005–2008 Palm Beach investigation: not fully released
- FBI surveillance of Epstein: extent unknown; records not fully FOIA'd successfully
- Foreign intelligence (CIA/NSA) files on Epstein: classification status unknown

---

## The Computers

### What Was Seized
- FBI seized computers, hard drives, CDs from [[Locations/9-East-71st-Street-NYC]] (July 2019)
- Court filings referenced "thousands of sexually explicit photographs"
- Prosecution stated some photos appeared taken without subjects' knowledge

### What's Unknown
- Full inventory of digital material never fully released to public
- Whether all digital material was recovered or some was encrypted/deleted: not established
- Encryption: reports that some devices were encrypted; whether fully decrypted by FBI is unclear
- Cloud storage accounts: whether Epstein used cloud backup of compromising material not established

---

## The Black Book — Partial

- Epstein's contact book ("Black Book") was photographed by butler Alfredo Rodriguez and leaked
- Published by Gawker in 2015
- The Black Book lists 1,000+ contacts — **but investigators never systematically pursued all contacts**
- Rodriguez was convicted of obstruction (attempted to sell the book) — his cooperation with prosecution was limited
- The Black Book is a documented object; **how many contacts were ever interviewed by FBI: not established**

---

## Victim List — Incomplete

- Maxwell conviction established trafficking of "minor victims" — the exact number is not public
- DOJ has not released a comprehensive list of all identified victims
- Many victims chose not to come forward
- The NPA (2008) victimised additional women by granting immunity to co-conspirators before they could be prosecuted
- True scope of victim count remains unknown — estimates range from dozens to hundreds

---

## The Palm Beach Investigation — Original Files

- Palm Beach PD began original investigation in 2005 based on tip from parents of victim
- Detective Joe Recarey conducted thorough investigation; built case against Epstein
- The case was then handed to State Attorney's office and subsequently to federal DOJ — where the NPA undermined it
- Detective Recarey has spoken publicly about case; his full files and the PD investigation records are not fully public
- Recarey died in 2018 — one year before Epstein's 2019 arrest (of natural causes per reporting)

---

## International Investigation Gaps

- **France**: Brunel was arrested in France (2020); died in custody (2022) before French investigation could fully proceed
- **UK**: Prince Andrew arrested 2026; UK investigation may surface new material
- **USVI**: Virgin Islands AG investigation ongoing; partial findings released
- **Australia**: Flight log destinations include Australia; no investigation reported
- **Middle East**: Sultan bin Sulayem (UAE) — UAE investigation: none reported
