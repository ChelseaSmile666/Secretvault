## Key Work

### 2003 New York Magazine Profile
- Ward wrote an early profile of Epstein for *Vanity Fair* (not New York Magazine — correction: it was Vanity Fair, 2003)
- Original draft included allegations from two women who said Epstein had assaulted them
- Epstein's representatives pressured the magazine to remove the allegations
- The allegations were edited out of the final published version
- Ward revealed this publicly in 2019 after Epstein's arrest — significant admission about editorial suppression

### Post-2019 Reporting
- Ward became a primary source of Epstein network reporting
- Air Mail article: documented Acosta's statement that Epstein "belonged to intelligence"
- Authored multiple long-form investigations post-arrest
- Co-author *Billion Dollar Loser* (WeWork) — experienced business journalist

### The Acosta "Intelligence" Statement
- Ward reported that Alexander Acosta told a Trump transition official: Epstein "belonged to intelligence and to leave it alone"
- This is one of the most significant documented statements about intelligence connections
- See [[Findings/Intelligence-Mossad-KGB-Connection]]
