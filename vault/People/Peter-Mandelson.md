## Allegations from DOJ Files (Public Record)

Per released DOJ Epstein files and reporting:

1. **Classified government documents**: Correspondence in DOJ files appears to show Mandelson forwarded an internal UK government report to Epstein — a report detailing how the UK might raise funds after the 2008 financial crisis. (Period: 2008–2010, when Mandelson was Business Secretary.)

2. **Bonus tax lobbying**: A separate email appears to show Mandelson telling Epstein he would lobby other UK government officials to reduce a tax on bankers' bonuses. (#claim — under investigation)

3. **"Best pal" note**: Earlier tranche of Epstein files (2025) revealed a handwritten note from Mandelson to Epstein calling him "my best pal" for Epstein's 50th birthday. This led to Mandelson's sacking as US Ambassador in September 2025.
