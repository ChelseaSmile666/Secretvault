## Methodology Note

The DOJ Epstein files portal at justice.gov/epstein requires age verification before serving document content. During automated or proxied retrieval on 2026-02-28, only the age-verification interstitial was returned for these five files. **No content inference has been made.** These entries serve solely to log that these EFTA codes exist within the released dataset and require direct human access for content extraction.
