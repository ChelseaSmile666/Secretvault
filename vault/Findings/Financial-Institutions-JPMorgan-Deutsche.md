## JPMorgan Chase — $290 Million Settlement (2023)

### The Settlement
- JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay **$290 million** to settle a class action brought by Epstein victims (June 2023)
- Separately, the US Virgin Islands government sued JPMorgan for enabling Epstein's trafficking
- JPMorgan agreed to pay the USVI **$75 million** (Sept 2023)
- Total JPMorgan exposure: ~$365 million

### What Was Admitted
- JPMorgan **maintained Epstein as a client from 1998 to 2013** — including years after his 2008 Florida conviction
- The bank processed **large cash withdrawals** — tens of thousands of dollars at a time — consistent with paying trafficking victims
- Internal compliance staff flagged Epstein multiple times; warnings were overridden by senior executives
- The bank continued serving Epstein because of his value as an introducer of other wealthy clients
- Jes Staley (see [[People/Jes-Staley]]) — Epstein's primary relationship manager at JPMorgan — was a key figure; Staley left JPMorgan in 2013 (same year Epstein was dropped as client)

### Key Staley Finding
- SDNY investigation found Staley received and sent thousands of emails with Epstein between 2008–2012
- Staley visited Epstein at Palm Beach home after 2008 conviction
- Staley later became CEO of Barclays; Barclays fined him and fired him over Epstein concealment
- FCA (UK Financial Conduct Authority) enforcement action against Staley ongoing

### Internal Warning Signs Ignored

| Year | Warning | Response |
|------|---------|---------|
| 2006 | Compliance flags Epstein (pre-conviction) | Ignored |
| 2008 | Epstein convicted — client review triggered | Maintained relationship |
| 2010–2012 | Multiple suspicious cash withdrawal flags | Overridden by management |
| 2013 | Epstein finally dropped as client | After Staley departure |

## Deutsche Bank — $150 Million Fine (2020)

### The Fine
- New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) fined Deutsche Bank **$150 million** (July 2020)
- Federal Reserve also took action
- Deutsche Bank admitted to "significant compliance failures" in managing the Epstein relationship

### Timeline
- Deutsche Bank accepted Epstein as client in **2013** — immediately after JPMorgan dropped him
- Maintained Epstein as client until **2018** — five years, years after his convicted sex offender status was universally known
- Processed ~$120 million in transactions including:
  - Payments to women with Eastern European names (potential trafficking victims)
  - Legal settlements
  - Cash withdrawals consistent with trafficking operations
  - Payments to Russian models #claim context

### What NYDFS Found
- Deutsche Bank processed transactions that should have triggered mandatory suspicious activity reports (SARs) — but did not file them
- Relationship managers were told not to file SARs on Epstein
- The bank served Epstein to attract his referrals of other wealthy clients

## The Banking Enablement Pattern

```
1998 ─── JPMorgan takes on Epstein as client
2006 ─── First compliance flags at JPMorgan (ignored)
2008 ─── Epstein convicted; JPMorgan maintains relationship
2013 ─── JPMorgan drops Epstein → Deutsche Bank immediately picks him up
2018 ─── Deutsche Bank drops Epstein
2019 ─── Epstein arrested
2020 ─── Deutsche Bank fined $150M
2023 ─── JPMorgan settles for $290M + $75M (USVI)
```

Both banks served Epstein for a combined **25 years** after warning signs.

## Why the Banks Kept Him

Court documents and regulatory findings establish:
1. **Revenue**: Epstein generated significant fee income and referral business
2. **Social capital**: Epstein's network of billionaires was valuable to banks' other business
3. **Senior protection**: Compliance staff warnings were consistently overridden at senior levels
4. **No consequence culture**: Banks calculated cost of compliance action < benefit of client retention
