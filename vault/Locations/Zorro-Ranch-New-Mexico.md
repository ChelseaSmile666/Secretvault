- Proceeds of auction designated to benefit Epstein victims
- San Rafael Ranch LLC created by Huffines family; New Mexico allows anonymous LLC property ownership
- Buyers stated they had never visited the property prior to auction listing
- Huffines family argued initial $21.1M valuation was overstated in part due to property's "notoriety"; Santa Fe County reassessed to $13.4M
