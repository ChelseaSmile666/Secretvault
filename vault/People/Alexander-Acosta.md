## Role in Epstein NPA (Public Court Record)

Per public records, congressional testimony, and Acosta's own statements:

- As SDFL US Attorney, Acosta supervised and signed the June 30, 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement (SDFL 08-80736)
- NPA allowed Epstein to plead to Florida state charges only, avoiding federal prosecution
- NPA extended immunity to unnamed "potential co-conspirators"
- Victims were not notified prior to signing — later ruled unconstitutional (*Doe v. United States*, Judge Marra, 2019)
- Acosta stated in 2019 press conference that he was told Epstein "belonged to intelligence" and to "leave it alone"; he said he was not sure what that meant. This claim was reported widely but Acosta distanced himself from the characterization in the same press conference.

> **Source for intelligence claim**: Miami Herald, reporting by Julie K. Brown (Nov 2018); Acosta press conference July 10, 2019 (public record)
