# Great Saint James — US Virgin Islands

> **Second private island.** Epstein purchased Great Saint James (GSJ) in addition to [[Locations/Little-Saint-James-USVI]]. Together, the two islands gave him control of an entire archipelago in the US Virgin Islands. GSJ was less developed and used as an expansion / buffer zone.

---

## Property Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Location | US Virgin Islands, adjacent to Little Saint James |
| Size | ~165 acres |
| Purchase | Epstein purchased GSJ circa 2016 |
| Status | Seized by USVI in legal proceedings post-2019 |
| Access | Private — surrounded by ocean; near St. John, USVI |

---

## Significance

### Buffer Zone / Expansion
- GSJ sits adjacent to Little Saint James — purchasing it gave Epstein control of both islands
- Created a completely private controlled archipelago
- Prevented development near LSJ; ensured privacy and security perimeter

### Limited Development (at time of seizure)
- GSJ was less developed than LSJ at time of Epstein's arrest
- Construction was underway on GSJ
- Purpose of planned structures not established

### USVI Government Seizure
- USVI Attorney General sued to seize Epstein's island properties as proceeds of crime
- GSJ included in seizure proceedings
- USVI v. Epstein's estate led to eventual settlement (USVI received ~$105M from Epstein estate)
