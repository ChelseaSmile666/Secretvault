## Connection to Jeffrey Epstein [CONFIRMED]

### The $158 Million in Payments (2012-2017)

The central documented financial connection between Black and Epstein consists of approximately $158 million in payments from Black to Epstein over a five-year period.

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Period | 2012-2017 |
| Total payments | ~$158 million |
| Stated purpose | Tax and estate planning advisory services |
| Context | All payments made after Epstein's 2008 Florida conviction |
| Disclosed by | Dechert LLP independent review (January 25, 2021) |

### Nature of the Relationship

- Black and Epstein were introduced in the 1990s through financial and social circles
- Epstein provided tax and estate planning advice to Black
- Black's representatives stated that Epstein's advice was "vetted by other professional advisors" and resulted in significant tax savings
- The Dechert LLP review found the payments were for "bona fide services"
- However, the scale of payments -- $158 million for advisory work -- was described as "extraordinarily large" relative to the work product, even by industry standards
- Black continued engaging Epstein after the 2008 conviction, when Epstein was a registered sex offender

## Dechert LLP Independent Review (2021) [CONFIRMED]

Apollo's Board of Directors commissioned an independent review conducted by law firm Dechert LLP.

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Commissioned by | Apollo Global Management Conflicts Committee |
| Outside counsel | Dechert LLP |
| Documents reviewed | 60,000+ emails, texts, and documents |
| Interviews conducted | 20+ individuals |
| Publication date | January 25, 2021 |

### Key Findings

1. **Payments were for bona fide services**: The review concluded that the $158 million was paid for legitimate tax and estate planning advice
2. **No evidence of criminal involvement**: The review found no evidence that Black participated in or was aware of Epstein's criminal activities
3. **Magnitude acknowledged**: The review acknowledged the payments were large, but attributed this to the complexity and value of the tax strategies involved
4. **No Apollo funds involved**: Black's payments to Epstein came from Black's personal wealth, not from Apollo corporate funds
5. **Limitation**: The review was commissioned by Apollo's board and relied on cooperation from Black; it was not a law enforcement investigation with subpoena power

### Critical Assessment

The Dechert review has been scrutinized on several grounds:

- It was commissioned and paid for by Apollo, creating potential conflicts of interest #claim
- It did not have access to Epstein's records (Epstein was deceased)
- The $158 million figure is orders of magnitude larger than typical advisory fees, even for ultra-high-net-worth individuals
- Senate Finance Committee later uncovered additional payment flows not fully addressed in the review #claim

| March 12, 2025 | Wyden (now Ranking Member) releases new information; evidence that payments may have financed Epstein's trafficking operations; requests documents from Trump Administration |
| 2026 | Investigation ongoing per public record |

### Key Congressional Findings

- March 2025 release suggested evidence that some of Black's payments to Epstein may have been used to fund Epstein's trafficking operation #claim
- Wyden requested documents from the Trump Administration regarding the DOJ's handling of Epstein financial records
