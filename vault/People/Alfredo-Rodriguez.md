## Connection to Epstein

### Role
- Rodriguez served as household manager at [[Locations/358-El-Brillo-Way-Palm-Beach]]
- In this role, had direct daily access to Epstein, his guests, his documents, and his operations
- Witnessed significant activity at the Palm Beach property during the period when criminal activity occurred

### The Black Book
- Rodriguez secretly photographed Epstein's personal contact book — a Rolodex/address book containing 1,000+ contacts
- The Black Book included names, phone numbers, and contact details for individuals across politics, finance, entertainment, royalty, and academia
- Rodriguez attempted to sell the book to attorneys representing Epstein victims
- His attempt to sell the book rather than cooperate with authorities led to his conviction

### Criminal Conviction
- Rodriguez was convicted of **obstruction of justice** (2010) for attempting to sell the Black Book
- Sentenced to 18 months in federal prison
- The conviction limited his usefulness as a cooperative witness

### The Black Book — Published
- After Rodriguez's arrest, the Black Book's contents became part of the public record
- Published by Gawker in 2015 — the full directory including 1,000+ names
- Cross-referencing the Black Book with flight logs is a key analytical method for establishing network connections
