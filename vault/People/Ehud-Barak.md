## Documented Relationship with Epstein

### Frequency and Nature of Contact

Per DOJ Epstein files and investigative journalism (Daily Mail, Ha'aretz, Haaretz, New York Post):

- Approximately **30 documented meetings** between Barak and Epstein, primarily 2013–2017
- Visited Epstein's properties in New York and elsewhere
- Was photographed entering Epstein's New York townhouse (9 East 71st Street) in 2016 — **during the period Epstein was registered sex offender** — by the Daily Mail
- Flew on Epstein's **private jet** on documented occasions
- Wife **Nili Prywes** also appears in Epstein-related correspondence in DOJ files

### Carbyne — Tech Startup Investment

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| Company | Carbyne (emergency services / 911 upgrade technology startup) |
| Barak's role | Co-founder / Chairman |
| Epstein's role | Investor — provided funding via his foundations |
| Funding amount | Reported as several million dollars (exact amount not publicly confirmed) |
| Other investors | Nicole Junkermann (later named in DOJ files), Peter Thiel's Founders Fund |
| Current status | Carbyne still operating post-Epstein; Barak remained involved |

Per Haaretz and New York Magazine reporting: Epstein was actively funding Barak's political efforts and the Carbyne venture simultaneously, raising questions about the nature of the financial relationship.

Per investigative reporting (Haaretz, 2019):
- Epstein was reported to have provided or facilitated funds to support Barak's attempt at a political comeback in Israel
- The financial assistance was provided through shell companies and intermediaries
- Barak acknowledged the relationship but characterised it as legitimate business/investment

## DOJ Files Reference

Per 2026 DOJ Epstein file release (justice.gov/epstein):
- Barak appears in email correspondence and contact records
- Communications between Epstein and associates reference Barak and his political activities
- No documentary evidence in released files connects Barak to trafficking operations

---

## Barak's Public Statements

Barak has acknowledged:
- Knowing Epstein; describing him as an "interesting" person with a wide network
- The Carbyne investment relationship
- **Denied** any knowledge of Epstein's crimes or trafficking
- **Denied** any sexual impropriety
- Acknowledged being photographed at the New York townhouse and said he was there for legitimate meetings

Per Ha'aretz interview (2019): Barak called Epstein "a brilliant man who made his fortune" and said he maintained the relationship because of Epstein's contacts and intellectual interests.

---

## Intelligence Context

Barak as former IDF Chief of Staff and PM had extensive intelligence-community connections. His documented relationship with Epstein is relevant context for assessments of Epstein's intelligence connections:

- Former CIA officer John Kiriakou has assessed Epstein as a Mossad "access agent" — Barak's frequent visits are consistent with this pattern (as documented professional opinion, not confirmed fact)
- See [[Findings/Intelligence-Connections]] for the full intelligence assessment record

> All intelligence-connection inferences above are documented professional assessments, not established court facts.
