# Zurab Mikeladze

> **Named in Epstein files — photo lineup only.** One of six names publicly revealed by Rep. [[People/Ro-Khanna]] during a 2026-02-10 House floor speech after reviewing unredacted DOJ Epstein files. Per Guardian reporting, four of the six men — including Mikeladze — had no connection to Epstein and appeared only as part of a law enforcement photo identification array. Two of the men denied knowing Epstein and said prior NYPD arrests for unrelated crimes likely explain their presence in the files. **Not charged with any crime in connection with Epstein. No wrongdoing established.**

## Connection Assessment

| Field | Value |

| Apparent file connection | Law enforcement photo lineup only #claim |
| Epstein relationship documented | None established |
| Criminal charges (Epstein) | None |
| Prior NYPD arrest (unrelated) | Possible — not confirmed for this individual specifically |

## Important Caveat

> Inclusion in the Epstein files does not establish guilt or any connection to Epstein's crimes. Per Guardian sourcing, this individual's photo appears to have been included in a law enforcement identification array unrelated to direct Epstein association. #claim
