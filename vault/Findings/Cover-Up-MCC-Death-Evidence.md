# Epstein Death — MCC Cover-Up Evidence

> **Partially documented.** The official ruling is suicide by hanging. Multiple anomalies are documented facts, not speculation. The cover-up theory is supported by documented evidence; full truth remains unestablished.

## Official Timeline — August 9–10, 2019

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| Aug 9, ~6:30 PM | Epstein placed on suicide watch (after July 23 "self-harm" incident) |

## Documented Anomalies

### Camera Failure — Documented
- Cameras outside Epstein's cell were **not functioning** on the night of his death
- DOJ Inspector General report (2019) confirmed camera failure
- Footage from the night is missing or corrupted
- A second camera in the area also failed
- The failure of multiple cameras simultaneously is extraordinary in a federal facility

### Guards Sleeping — Documented (Criminal Charges)
- Two guards assigned to check on Epstein **both fell asleep** and failed to make mandatory checks
- Guards were supposed to check every 30 minutes — failed to do so for approximately **3 hours**
- Both guards (Tova Noel and Michael Thomas) were charged with falsifying prison records (making false entries claiming checks were conducted)
- Charges were eventually dropped in 2021 (insufficient evidence of willfulness per prosecutors)

### Removal from Suicide Watch — Documented
- Epstein was removed from suicide watch only **hours** after a prior self-harm incident (July 23)
- Standard protocol requires extended monitoring
- The rapid removal is documented in DOJ IG report as procedurally irregular

### Cellmate Removed — Documented
- Epstein's cellmate was transferred the day before his death
- He was left alone in his cell — against standard protocol for high-risk inmates
- The cellmate transfer was reportedly routine (routine transfer) but the timing is notable

## Medical Evidence — Disputed

### Dr. Michael Baden's Findings
- Epstein's brother Mark hired renowned forensic pathologist Dr. **Michael Baden** to observe the autopsy
- Baden concluded the injuries were **more consistent with homicidal strangulation than suicide**
- Specific findings:
  - Fractures in the hyoid bone — more common in strangulation than suicide by hanging
  - Fractures in the cartilage around the larynx — also more common in strangulation
  - Multiple hemorrhages in the eyes (petechial hemorrhages) — consistent with both but pattern noted
- NYC Medical Examiner Dr. Barbara Sampson maintained suicide ruling; called hyoid fractures "not unusual" in older adults in hanging deaths

### Official vs. Baden
| Finding | Official ME | Dr. Baden |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Cause of death | Suicide by hanging | Consistent with homicidal strangulation |
| Hyoid fractures | Not unusual in hanging | More typical of strangulation |
| Final ruling | Suicide (maintained) | "Undetermined" preferred |

## DOJ / FBI Investigation

- FBI launched investigation into Epstein's death immediately
- DOJ Inspector General report released 2021: documented multiple BOP failures but reached no conclusion on foul play
- Two senior BOP officials fired/demoted
- Criminal charges against guards eventually dropped
- **No person charged with homicide; no determination of homicide made officially**

## "Suicide" Context Problems

### Why Suicide Is Questioned
1. Epstein told lawyers he feared for his life after the July 23 incident
2. Epstein had a potential cooperation agreement with prosecutors — had motive to stay alive
3. He had just received visit from lawyers; appeared "in good spirits"
4. Hundreds of powerful people had motive to silence him
5. The technical anomalies (cameras, guards, cellmate) all occurred simultaneously

### Prior Incident (July 23, 2019)
- Found semi-conscious in cell with marks on his neck
- Cellmate at the time claimed it was a jailhouse assault, not self-harm #claim
- Official characterisation: possible self-harm or attempted suicide
- Investigation into that incident also inconclusive

---

## Evidence Gaps

- Camera footage: **not recovered** (failure vs. deletion unresolved)
- Toxicology: standard; no unusual substances found
- Cell contents: not fully disclosed publicly
- Guards' full testimony: not in public record
- Whether any third party accessed his cell: not established
