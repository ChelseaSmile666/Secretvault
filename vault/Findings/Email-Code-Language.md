# Email Code Language — Communication Patterns

> **Documented.** The Maxwell trial and DOJ file releases have revealed systematic coded language used by Epstein's network in written communications. This is an open area of ongoing analysis.

---

## Confirmed Codes (Maxwell Trial Evidence)

### "Massage" — Primary Code

| Code | Meaning | Evidence |
|------|---------|---------|
| "Massage" | Sexual services performed by or on victims | Maxwell trial testimony; victim accounts; property setups |
| "Masseuse" | Victim/trafficked person | Used in scheduling communications |
| "Massage table" | Setup for sexual activity | Present on Lolita Express, in all properties |

- The term "massage" was the primary operational cover word
- Used in scheduling: "I need a massage at 3pm" = directing a victim to perform sexual acts
- Sarah Kellen ([[People/Sarah-Kellen]]) managed "massage" scheduling across properties
- Flight attendant testimony confirmed "massage" usage on the aircraft

### "Travel" / "Visiting"
- Directed movement of victims between properties
- "She's traveling to the island" = victim being moved to Little Saint James
- "Visiting the ranch" = Zorro Ranch transfer

## EFTA Code References — DOJ Documents

### EFTA00008744 — Scopolamine Emails
- See full documentation: [[Findings/Scopolamine-Drugging-Evidence]]
- Emails discuss scopolamine ("devil's breath") acquisition and use
- Context suggests chemical facilitation of victim compliance
- Language in emails uses indirect reference to the substance — not named directly in all instances

### EFTA00666117 — Sultan Bin Sulayem
- Email chain referencing a "torture video" involving Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem ([[People/Sultan-Ahmed-bin-Sulayem]])
- Document describes identifying Sultan in video footage
- This is the code reference that led to Sultan's departure from DP World (Feb 2026)

## Communication Security Patterns

### Deletion and Timing
- Maxwell trial revealed instructions to delete communications after reading
- Specific emails showed awareness that communications could be discoverable
- Some communications deliberately vague — deniable language throughout

### The "Girls" Language
- Maxwell and others used "girls" to refer to victims in communications
- Trial evidence showed this was a deliberate euphemism
- Used in emails to Epstein about sending or receiving "girls"

### Financial Code
- Victim payments often characterized as "massage fees" in financial records
- This connected the code language to the financial network

---

## Broader Pattern Analysis

### Layered Deniability
The communication pattern was designed with multiple layers of deniability:
1. **Surface meaning**: Normal legitimate activity (massage, travel, visiting)
2. **Network meaning**: Known to participants, not to outsiders
3. **Document-safe**: Discoverable communications contain no explicit illegality on face

### The "Nothing on Paper" Principle
- Maxwell trial established that certain key communications were verbal or quickly deleted
- The Blackmail operation's most sensitive elements were apparently handled off-record
- See [[Findings/Blackmail-Operation]]

## Open Analysis Tasks

- [ ] Systematic review of EFTA codes across DOJ 3.5M page release
- [ ] Full codebook: document all identified euphemisms in trial record
- [ ] Cross-reference code language with specific operational events in Timeline
- [ ] Analyse whether code language changed after 2008 conviction (greater operational security?)
