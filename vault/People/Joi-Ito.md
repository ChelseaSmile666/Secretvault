## MIT Media Lab — Documented Cover-Up

### The Donations
- MIT Media Lab accepted **$7.5 million+** from Epstein over several years — some after his 2008 conviction
- Ito personally solicited donations from Epstein post-conviction, knowing Epstein was a registered sex offender
- Donations were deliberately recorded as "anonymous" in MIT records to conceal Epstein's identity
- Internal emails (leaked to New Yorker investigative reporter Ronan Farrow) show Ito directing staff to keep Epstein connection secret

### The New Yorker Investigation
- Ronan Farrow and Jill Lepore published "How an Élite University Research Center Concealed Its Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein" (September 2019)
- Internal MIT emails showed Ito writing: "given the [issue] around Epstein, we are keeping his name out of things"
- Lab staff instructed to refer to Epstein as "a friend of a friend" when discussing donations
- Farrow's reporting directly triggered MIT investigation and Ito's resignation

### Resignation (September 7, 2019)
- Ito resigned as MIT Media Lab director
- Resigned from multiple corporate boards simultaneously (New York Times, MacArthur Foundation, Knight Foundation, PureTech Health, Ithaka Harbours)
- MIT President Rafael Reif issued formal apology
- MIT launched independent investigation (Goodwin Procter LLP review)

### Personal Relationship with Epstein
- Ito acknowledged meeting Epstein multiple times
- Epstein introduced Ito to potential investors including [[People/Bill-Gates]]
- Ito visited Epstein at his New York townhouse ([[Locations/9-East-71st-Street-NYC]])
- Epstein attended MIT Media Lab events
