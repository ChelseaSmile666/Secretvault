> **Status: Active** — Investigative journalist; author of *One Nation Under Blackmail* (2022).

## Key Work

### *One Nation Under Blackmail* (2022) — Two Volumes
- Comprehensive documented history connecting:
  - Epstein's operation to US/Israeli intelligence structures
  - The Robert Maxwell/Mossad connection
  - The organized crime connections (particularly Meyer Lansky network)
  - The PROMIS software operation
  - The role of Roy Cohn (McCarthy-era lawyer) as predecessor node in the elite compromise network
  - Leslie Wexner's rise and Epstein connection
- Heavily footnoted; primary sources throughout
- Available: unlimitedhangout.com and Trine Day publishing

### Roy Cohn Connection (Webb's Key Thesis)
- Webb documents that Roy Cohn (McCarthy's counsel; Trump's mentor; mob-connected lawyer) operated a similar honey trap network in New York in the 1970s–80s
- Cohn ran young men to politicians and executives; documented by multiple witnesses
- Webb argues Epstein's operation was a continuation and evolution of the Cohn network
- Cohn died 1986; Epstein began rising to prominence in the late 1980s
- The connection is circumstantial but well-documented in primary sources #claim as causal link

### Intelligence Asset Theory
- Webb's most controversial thesis: Epstein was a joint Mossad/CIA asset running an intelligence-collection blackmail operation with state backing
- Supported by: NPA anomalies, [[People/Robert-Maxwell]] documented Mossad connection, Acosta "belongs to intelligence" statement, scale of operation
- See [[Findings/Intelligence-Mossad-KGB-Connection]]

## Methodology Note

Webb's work is notable for sourcing — every claim is footnoted to primary documents, government records, or contemporaneous journalism. This makes her work unusually verifiable compared to other Epstein researchers.
