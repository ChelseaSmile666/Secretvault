## The Core Question (Congressional and Media Record)

The central documented controversy: Why did the DOJ's Southern District of Florida agree to a non-prosecution deal in 2008 that:
1. Avoided federal charges entirely
2. Granted immunity to unnamed co-conspirators
3. Was kept secret from victims (later ruled unconstitutional)
4. Allowed work-release after only 13 months

## Documented Decision-Makers (Public Record)

### US Attorney Level — SDFL

| Person | Role | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| [[People/Alexander-Acosta]] | US Attorney, SDFL | Signed and approved NPA June 30, 2008 |
| A. Marie Villafaña | AUSA, SDFL (lead prosecutor) | Negotiated NPA terms with Epstein defense |

> Source: Court documents, Acosta's own 2019 press conference, Senate Judiciary inquiry

### Epstein Defense Team (Public Record)

| Person | Role |
|--------|------|
| Jay Lefkowitz | Lead defense attorney |
| Jack Goldberger | Florida defense counsel |
| Alan Dershowitz | Consulting attorney (per public statements and civil filings) |

### Main Justice Involvement (Documented but Partial)

Acosta stated in his 2019 press conference that "the matter had been reviewed and approved by the [DOJ]" and that he had briefed Washington. The extent of Main Justice involvement has not been fully established in public record.

- Senate Judiciary Committee requested Main Justice correspondence in 2019; DOJ response was incomplete per committee public statements
- OPR (Office of Professional Responsibility) opened review into SDFL handling; results not fully public

## "Intelligence" Claim (Public Record — Disputed)

Reporting by Julie K. Brown (Miami Herald, 2018) and subsequent corroboration:
- Acosta told Trump transition officials that he was told Epstein "belonged to intelligence" and to "leave it alone" (#claim — Acosta denied the framing at his 2019 press conference while acknowledging the conversation)
- No public government document has confirmed Epstein was an intelligence asset
- This remains a documented claim, not a verified fact
