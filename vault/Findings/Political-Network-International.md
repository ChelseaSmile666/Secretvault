# Epstein Political Network — International (Comprehensive)

> **Classification: HIGH-PRIORITY SYNTHESIS FINDING.** This document maps the documented relationships between Jeffrey Epstein and political figures across the United States, United Kingdom, Israel, Europe, and the Gulf states. It is derived from flight logs, DOJ files released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act (2025–2026), court records in multiple jurisdictions, civil proceedings, congressional inquiries, and established investigative journalism. All civil allegations against living non-convicted individuals are tagged **#claim**. Documentary evidence is distinguished from civil allegations, which are distinguished from charges and convictions.

---

## Overview

Jeffrey Epstein's operation was not merely a criminal enterprise sustained by wealth — it was a political enterprise sustained by relationships. The documented record across three decades of Epstein's activities shows a systematic cultivation of political figures at the highest levels of multiple governments: two US presidents, the brother of a reigning British monarch, the former Prime Minister of Israel, multiple European heads of government and senior officials, a Council of Europe Secretary General, royalty, and a Gulf ports-authority executive who controlled infrastructure in eighty countries.

The function of these political connections operated at several documented levels:

1. **Legitimacy**: Association with heads of state and senior ministers created a social imprimatur that deflected scrutiny and enabled continued access.
2. **Protection**: Political connections are documented as a factor — by the US Attorney who signed the 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement — in the decision not to federally prosecute Epstein.
3. **Commercial access**: Epstein used political contacts to generate business introductions and position himself as a geopolitical intermediary.
4. **Blackmail potential**: The documented presence of hidden cameras across Epstein properties and the photographing of guests without consent created the structural preconditions for coercive leverage (see [[Findings/Blackmail-Operation]]).

As of the vault date (2026-02-28), two individuals — one former member of the British royal family and one former UK Ambassador — have been arrested and are under active criminal investigation in the United Kingdom in direct consequence of documentary evidence in the released DOJ files. Multiple senior figures across three continents have resigned from positions of public trust.

**Distinction framework used throughout this document:**

| Evidentiary category | Definition |
|---|---|
| Documented | Confirmed by flight logs, DOJ files, court records, or official statements |
| Reported | Established major journalism; not yet confirmed by official records |
| Alleged / #claim | Civil allegations, unverified tips, unproven assertions against living persons |
| Charged | Subject of formal criminal charge |
| Convicted | Found guilty by court |

## US Political Connections

### [[People/Bill-Clinton]] — 42nd President of the United States

**Summary of documented relationship:** Clinton appears on Epstein flight logs at least 26 times. His presence on the aircraft, including travel to Epstein's private island, is established by contemporaneous pilot logs and reviewed by multiple major outlets. Clinton's post-2019 account of the relationship is contradicted in material respects by the documentary record.

#### Flight Log Record (Documented)

Epstein's Boeing 727-200 (tail number N908JE, the "Lolita Express") pilot logs, obtained via subpoena in civil proceedings and subsequently published, show Clinton aboard the aircraft on at least 26 occasions (Fox News, 2016, review of complete log set). Flights included travel to Europe, Africa, and Asia, with stated purposes often cited by Clinton's office as Clinton Foundation work. The logs place [[People/Ghislaine-Maxwell]] aboard multiple Clinton flights — confirmed by Fox News and independent log review. The logs also document travel to [[Locations/Little-Saint-James-USVI]], Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands (Fox News, 2016).

Clinton's office issued a statement in 2019 acknowledging four flights on Epstein's aircraft, citing trips for "a number of projects" — a figure contradicted by the contemporaneous pilot logs showing at minimum 26 segments (Fox News, 2016). Clinton denied ever visiting Epstein's properties or having knowledge of crimes.

The 2019 statement also asserted that Secret Service was present throughout. This claim was specifically contradicted by reporting on the flight log manifests, which show at least some flights without a Secret Service detail on board (Fox News, 2016). The number of flights on which Secret Service was absent has not been definitively established in the public record.

#### Giuffre Civil Documents (January 2024)

Documents released pursuant to Judge Loretta Preska's December 2023 order in *Giuffre v. Maxwell* (SDNY 15-CV-07433) reference Clinton in the context of Epstein's social network. Virginia Giuffre did not specifically allege sexual conduct by Clinton in the released documents. Clinton was named in deposition context as part of a broader mapping of Epstein's circle (PACER, SDNY 15-CV-07433, 2024). All such references constitute civil deposition context, not criminal allegations.

#### 2026 DOJ Files

Per the 2026 DOJ file release (justice.gov/epstein), Clinton is mentioned in released documents. No wrongdoing has been established by the released material (CBS News, 2026).

#### Clinton Foundation Links (Documented)

Epstein donated to the Clinton Foundation, though the precise amount has not been publicly confirmed. Multiple Epstein-associated figures — including [[People/Les-Wexner]] — were also Clinton Foundation donors, indicating overlapping financial networks (Brown, 2018, Miami Herald "Perversion of Justice").

#### Status Assessment

| Evidentiary element | Status |
|---|---|
| Flight logs showing 26+ Epstein flights | Documented (Fox News, 2016; pilot logs) |
| Travel to Little Saint James | Documented (flight logs) |
| Maxwell on same flights | Documented (flight logs) |
| Donation to Clinton Foundation | Reported (amount not confirmed) |
| Sexual conduct allegations | Not made in public record; #claim does not apply as no allegations have been formally advanced |
| Criminal charges | None |

### [[People/Donald-Trump]] — 45th and 47th President of the United States

**Summary of documented relationship:** Trump and Epstein had a documented social connection from approximately 1987 to 2002, centred on shared membership at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach and New York social circles. Trump banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago in 2007 following reports of Epstein's abuse of a club member's daughter. FBI interview summaries containing unverified and unsubstantiated allegations against Trump — explicitly flagged by the DOJ as potentially fabricated — were withheld from the primary January 2026 release, provoking bipartisan congressional scrutiny.

#### Documented Pre-2002 Social Connection

Trump and Epstein appear in documented proximity in the New York and Palm Beach social worlds from the late 1980s. Trump gave an interview to New York Magazine in 2002 in which he described Epstein as "a terrific guy" and said he was "fun to be with," adding that Epstein "likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side" (New York Magazine, 2002, as cited in subsequent reporting). This statement has been cited as evidence of contemporaneous knowledge of Epstein's preferences — though Trump's counsel has characterised it as a routine social remark.

#### Mar-a-Lago Membership (Documented)

Epstein held membership at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private club in Palm Beach. Per reporting confirmed by legal proceedings, Trump terminated Epstein's membership in approximately 2007 after learning that Epstein had allegedly approached the minor daughter of a Mar-a-Lago member (Brown, 2018, Miami Herald). This termination predates any federal prosecution of Epstein and has been cited by Trump's office as evidence of early distance from Epstein's conduct.

#### FBI 302 Reports — Withheld Allegations (#claim)

Three FBI Form 302 reports — comprising 25 pages of agents' notes memorialising four interview sessions conducted with a single witness in summer and fall 2019 — were not included in the DOJ's January 30, 2026 primary release under the Epstein Files Transparency Act (The Guardian, 2026-02-26). The Guardian obtained and reviewed the withheld 302s; their existence was first reported by investigative journalist Roger Sollenberger and confirmed by NPR.

The 302s describe a woman who came forward after recognising Epstein in a photograph. Only the **first interview session** — in which she did not name Trump — appeared in the public release. The three subsequent sessions contain explicit but unsubstantiated allegations that Trump sexually abused the woman as a minor in the early 1980s, allegedly with Epstein's involvement (#claim). The Guardian specifically noted her statements "at times appear outlandish" and "contradict what is known about Epstein's life in the early 1980s" (The Guardian, 2026-02-26). The FBI brought no charges on the basis of these accounts.

An administration official confirmed the three withheld reports are authentic but characterised the allegations as "non-credible" and described the material as "duplicative" under the terms of the Epstein Files Transparency Act as drafted by Congress (The Guardian, 2026-02-26). The DOJ told NPR that "nothing has been deleted" and that withheld material was "duplicative or privileged."

A separate FBI internal slideshow summarising the Epstein and Maxwell investigations — created in 2025 — was released; it included a summary of the 302 allegations. This document is in the public domain at justice.gov/epstein.

Congressional investigations, on a bipartisan basis, have been opened into the withheld 302s (DOJ Epstein files, 2026).

#### Legislative Role

Trump signed the **Epstein Files Transparency Act** into law in November 2025, authorising the release of more than three million pages of files (Wikipedia, Epstein files article). Trump has characterised controversy surrounding the files as "fabricated by members of the Democratic Party" (The Guardian, 2026-02-26; CBS News, 2026). Trump stated approximately February 20, 2026: "I did nothing" (The Guardian, 2026-02-26).

### [[People/Alexander-Acosta]] — US Attorney SDFL; later Secretary of Labor

**Summary of documented role:** Acosta signed the 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement that allowed Epstein to avoid federal prosecution, plead to state charges only, and serve 13 months of an 18-month sentence on a work-release arrangement. The NPA was later found to have violated victims' rights. Acosta stated he was told Epstein "belonged to intelligence" — a claim that, if true, indicates political and intelligence pressure at the highest level of the NPA decision chain.

#### The Non-Prosecution Agreement (Documented — SDFL 08-80736)

The NPA signed June 30, 2008 by Acosta as US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida:

- Declined all federal charges against Epstein
- Allowed guilty plea to Florida state charges only: solicitation of prostitution and solicitation involving a minor
- Sentenced Epstein to 18 months in Palm Beach County Stockade; served 13 months on work-release (12 hours per day, six days per week)
- Extended immunity to "any potential co-conspirators" — unnamed
- Was kept secret from victims — later ruled unconstitutional under the Crime Victims' Rights Act by Judge Kenneth Marra in *Does 1-6 v. United States* (SDFL), February 21, 2019

The NPA's co-conspirator immunity clause effectively shielded any individual who had participated in Epstein's conduct from federal prosecution for the period covered (SDFL 08-80736, public record).

#### The "Intelligence" Claim (Documented — Disputed)

Reporting by Miami Herald investigative journalist Julie K. Brown (*Perversion of Justice* series, November 2018) — subsequently corroborated — established that Acosta told Trump transition officials in 2016–2017 that he had been informed Epstein "belonged to intelligence" and that he should "leave it alone" (Brown, 2018, Miami Herald). At his public press conference on July 10, 2019, Acosta neither denied the conversation nor confirmed it with precision; he stated he was uncertain what "belonged to intelligence" meant and distanced himself from the characterisation while acknowledging the substance of the discussion (Acosta press conference, July 10, 2019, C-SPAN).

No government agency has officially confirmed Epstein was an intelligence asset. This claim is documented as stated by Acosta, not as an established fact (see [[Findings/Intelligence-Connections]]).

#### DOJ Internal Review

Acosta stated at his press conference that the NPA had been "reviewed and approved" by the Department of Justice in Washington — implying Main Justice involvement at a level above the SDFL (Acosta, 2019). The Senate Judiciary Committee demanded Main Justice correspondence in 2019; the DOJ response was characterised by the committee as incomplete (Senate Judiciary Committee public letters, 2019). The DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) opened a review into the SDFL's handling of the Epstein matter; no public report had been released as of vault date.

#### Congressional Record

Acosta resigned as Secretary of Labor on July 19, 2019, nine days after Epstein's July 8, 2019 federal indictment and three days after his public press conference. He did not testify before Congress following the indictment; the Senate Judiciary Committee continued its inquiry after his departure (Senate Judiciary Committee, 2019).

#### Status Assessment

| Evidentiary element | Status |
|---|---|
| Signed 2008 NPA | Documented — public court record |
| NPA found to violate CVRA | Documented — Judge Marra, Feb 2019 |
| NPA immunity to co-conspirators | Documented — text of NPA |
| Intelligence claim | Documented as Acosta's statement; not confirmed by any agency |
| Main Justice knowledge | Stated by Acosta; scope unclear; OPR inquiry ongoing |
| Criminal charges against Acosta | None |

## UK Political Connections

### [[People/Prince-Andrew]] — Former Duke of York

**Summary of documented relationship:** Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor had a documented personal friendship with Epstein from approximately 2000 until 2019. He stayed at Epstein's New York townhouse in December 2010 — after Epstein's 2008 conviction and registration as a sex offender. He settled a civil lawsuit by Virginia Giuffre in February 2022. He was arrested on February 19, 2026 — his 66th birthday — on suspicion of misconduct in public office, arising from evidence in the released DOJ files that he forwarded a classified UK government document to Epstein during his tenure as UK trade envoy in 2010.

#### Documented Friendship Timeline

| Date | Event | Source |
|---|---|---|
| ~2000 | Introduction to Epstein reportedly via Ghislaine Maxwell | Major journalism |
| 2000–2010 | Ongoing documented contact and social relationship | Public record |
| Dec 2010 | Stayed at Epstein's 9 East 71st Street NYC townhouse — **after** Epstein's 2008 conviction | Buckingham Palace confirmation |
| 2011 | Public photograph taken at New York townhouse walk | Published photography |
| 2019-11-16 | BBC Newsnight interview: denied Giuffre allegations, no memory of meeting her | BBC public broadcast |
| 2019-11-20 | Stepped back from royal duties | Royal Family public announcement |
| 2022-01 | Stripped of HRH title and military affiliations | Royal Family public announcement |
| 2022-02 | Settled Giuffre v. Prince Andrew (SDNY 21-CV-06702) | Court record, PACER |
| 2026-02-19 | Arrested by Thames Valley Police on suspicion of misconduct in public office | NBC News, CBS News, CNN, NPR (Feb 19–20, 2026) |

#### Flight Logs (Documented)

Flight logs show Andrew on Epstein aircraft on documented occasions (Lolita-Express N908JE logs, Giuffre v. Maxwell civil discovery). The precise number of flights has not been definitively established in the public record.

#### BBC Newsnight Interview (November 16, 2019)

Andrew gave a live interview to Emily Maitlis on BBC Newsnight in which he denied all allegations made by Virginia Giuffre, stated he had "no recollection" of meeting her, and offered a series of explanations subsequently criticised as implausible. The interview was widely characterised by media and crisis communications professionals as one of the most damaging self-conducted interviews in British public life. He resigned from royal duties four days later.

#### Giuffre Civil Settlement (February 2022 — SDNY 21-CV-06702)

Virginia Giuffre filed suit on August 9, 2021 in the Southern District of New York alleging sexual abuse (#claim — unproven in court). Andrew settled in February 2022, agreeing to donate to Giuffre's victims' charity. The settlement was explicitly not an admission of liability (PACER, SDNY 21-CV-06702).

#### Arrest — February 19, 2026 (Documented — Not Convicted)

Thames Valley Police arrested Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on February 19, 2026 on suspicion of misconduct in public office (NBC News, CBS News, CNN, NPR, CNBC, Feb 19–20, 2026). The specific allegation is that Andrew, while serving as UK Special Representative for International Trade and Investment (2001–2011), forwarded an internal UK government document — a report from his special adviser about Andrew's Southeast Asia visit — to Epstein. The document appears in the released DOJ files as an email (NBC News, 2026).

Andrew was held for approximately 11 hours and released "under investigation" — a formal status in UK law meaning he has not been charged but remains subject to investigation. If charged and convicted of misconduct in public office, the maximum sentence in England and Wales is life imprisonment. He had made no public statement as of vault date.

His arrest was the first of a member of the British royal family in several centuries. UK commentators subsequently reported parliamentary discussions about removing Andrew from the line of succession to the throne (NPR, 2026-02-20).

#### Status Assessment

| Evidentiary element | Status |
|---|---|
| Documented friendship with Epstein | Documented |
| 2010 stay at Epstein NYC townhouse post-conviction | Documented — Buckingham Palace confirmed |
| Flight log appearances | Documented |

| Forwarding classified document to Epstein | Under criminal investigation; not proven in court |
| Arrested Feb 19, 2026 | Documented |
| Criminal charges | None as of vault date — released under investigation |

### [[People/Peter-Mandelson]] — Former UK Business Secretary; Former UK Ambassador to United States

**Summary of documented relationship:** Mandelson was among the most politically significant figures named in the DOJ files. A handwritten personal note calling Epstein "my best pal" led to his sacking as UK Ambassador to the United States in September 2025. Subsequent DOJ file releases produced documentary evidence of the communication of UK government information to Epstein during Mandelson's tenure as Business Secretary (2008–2010). He was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on February 23, 2026.

#### Government Roles Relevant to Investigation

| Period | Role |
|---|---|
| 1997–1998 | Secretary of State for Trade and Industry |
| 2004–2008 | EU Trade Commissioner (Brussels) |
| 2008–2010 | Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills |
| 2025 | UK Ambassador to the United States (appointed by PM Keir Starmer) |
| September 2025 | Sacked as US Ambassador |
| February 23–24, 2026 | Arrested; released on bail |

#### DOJ Files Evidence (Documented)

Three distinct categories of documentary evidence appear in the released DOJ Epstein files concerning Mandelson:

1. **"Best pal" handwritten note** (2025 release): A handwritten note from Mandelson to Epstein, sent for Epstein's 50th birthday, in which Mandelson addressed him as "my best pal." This note was identified in an earlier tranche of released DOJ files and triggered the September 2025 decision by Prime Minister Keir Starmer to remove Mandelson as UK Ambassador (Wikipedia, Relationship of Peter Mandelson and Jeffrey Epstein).

2. **UK government financial document** (January 2026 release): Email correspondence in the released DOJ files appears to show Mandelson forwarding to Epstein an internal UK government report addressing how the UK might raise funds following the 2008 financial crisis. This allegedly occurred during the period when Mandelson was Secretary of State for Business (NPR, CNN, Washington Post, Feb 23, 2026).

3. **Bankers' bonus tax lobbying** (#claim — under investigation): A separate email appears to show Mandelson indicating to Epstein that he would lobby other UK government officials to reduce a proposed tax on bankers' bonuses (CNBC, Feb 23, 2026). This allegation remains under investigation.

#### Political and Legal Consequences

- September 2025: Sacked as UK Ambassador by PM Starmer
- February 23, 2026: Arrested by Metropolitan Police (London) on suspicion of misconduct in public office
- February 24, 2026: Released on bail, approximately 2:00 AM
- Status: Under criminal investigation, not charged, not convicted as of vault date
- Maximum sentence if charged and convicted: Life imprisonment (England and Wales)

#### Status Assessment

| Evidentiary element | Status |
|---|---|
| "Best pal" note to Epstein | Documented — in DOJ files |
| Forwarding UK government financial document | Under investigation; documentary evidence in DOJ files |
| Lobbying on bankers' bonus tax on Epstein's behalf | #claim — under investigation |
| Arrested Feb 23, 2026 | Documented |
| Criminal charges | None as of vault date |

### Børge Brende — World Economic Forum President

Børge Brende served as WEF President and CEO and previously as Norwegian Foreign Minister (2013–2017). His resignation from the WEF was announced on February 26, 2026, following revelation of post-2008 Epstein correspondence in the released DOJ files (2026-DOJ-Epstein-Files-Release.md; Al Jazeera, Feb 24, 2026). The nature of the correspondence has been reported but the full content has not been publicly released. No criminal charges have been filed. Brende's resignation represents a significant consequence given the WEF's role as a convening institution for global political and business leadership.

---

### Jack Lang — President, Arab World Institute; Former French Culture Minister

Jack Lang served as French Minister of Culture under President François Mitterrand and subsequently as President of the Arab World Institute (Institut du monde arabe) in Paris. Lang was named in the 2026 DOJ file release in connection with Epstein and was placed under French investigation, leading to his resignation from the Arab World Institute in February 2026 (Al Jazeera, Feb 24, 2026; 2026-DOJ-Epstein-Files-Release.md). The precise allegations under French investigation have not been fully established in the public record as of vault date. No charges have been filed.

---

### Brad Karp — Chairman, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP

Brad Karp, chairman of the major US law firm Paul Weiss, stepped down from that role in February 2026 following revelations of Epstein ties in the released DOJ files (2026-DOJ-Epstein-Files-Release.md; TIME, 2026). Paul Weiss is among the most politically connected law firms in the United States, with extensive relationships in Democratic Party legal circles. Karp's departure reflects the legal profession's exposure within the Epstein network, complementing the earlier exposure of [[People/Alan-Dershowitz]] and the NPA negotiation. No criminal charges have been filed against Karp.

---

## Israeli Political Connections

### [[People/Ehud-Barak]] — Former Prime Minister of Israel; Former Defense Minister; IDF Chief of Staff

**Summary of documented relationship:** Barak is among the most extensively documented political figures in the Epstein network outside the United States. He met Epstein approximately 30 times between 2013 and 2017, flew on Epstein's aircraft, co-invested with Epstein in a technology startup, and was photographed entering Epstein's New York townhouse in 2016 — during the period when Epstein was a registered sex offender — by the Daily Mail. No allegations of sexual wrongdoing have been made against Barak by any victim.

#### Documented Meeting Frequency

Per DOJ Epstein files and investigative journalism: approximately 30 documented meetings between Barak and Epstein, primarily 2013–2017, at Epstein properties in New York and elsewhere (Daily Mail, 2016; Haaretz, 2019; DOJ files, justice.gov/epstein). Barak was photographed entering the 9 East 71st Street townhouse in April 2016 by Daily Mail photographers — a visit occurring when Epstein was a registered sex offender living at that address (Daily Mail, 2016). Barak acknowledged the visit and said it was for legitimate meetings.

#### Carbyne — Technology Investment (Documented)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| Company | Carbyne (emergency services / 911 upgrade technology startup) |
| Barak's role | Co-founder and Chairman |
| Epstein's role | Investor — provided funding via foundations |
| Additional investors | Nicole Junkermann (named in DOJ files); Peter Thiel's Founders Fund |
| Status | Carbyne continued to operate after Epstein's death |

Per Haaretz and New York Magazine reporting, Epstein was simultaneously funding the Carbyne venture and what was characterised as Barak's political comeback efforts in Israel, raising questions about the transactional nature of the relationship. Barak characterised the arrangement as legitimate business (Haaretz, 2019).

#### Funding of Political Activities (#claim — Disputed)

Haaretz investigative reporting (2019) described Epstein as providing or facilitating funds to support Barak's attempt at a political return in Israel, channelled through intermediary structures. Barak acknowledged the relationship but contested the characterisation, describing the financial relationship as legitimate investment (Haaretz, 2019; New York Post, 2019).

#### Flight Logs

Barak flew on Epstein's private aircraft on documented occasions. The specific flights have been reported in investigative journalism but are not fully detailed in the public record as of vault date (Haaretz, 2019).

#### Intelligence Context

Barak's status as a former IDF Chief of Staff, former Prime Minister, and former Defense Minister — with commensurate intelligence community connections — makes his documented relationship with Epstein a significant data point in the assessment of Epstein's possible intelligence affiliations. Former CIA officer John Kiriakou has assessed Epstein as a Mossad "access agent" — a professional assessment, not a confirmed intelligence record (see [[Findings/Intelligence-Connections]]). Barak's frequent documented visits are consistent with the access-agent pattern as described by Kiriakou, though this is analytical inference, not documentary proof.

#### Status Assessment

| Evidentiary element | Status |
|---|---|
| ~30 meetings with Epstein 2013–2017 | Documented |
| Flew on Epstein jet | Documented |
| Photographed at Epstein NYC townhouse (2016) | Documented (Daily Mail photos) |
| Carbyne co-investment with Epstein | Documented |
| Epstein funding Barak's political activities | Reported by Haaretz; Barak contests characterisation |
| Knowledge of trafficking | Not established |
| Sexual conduct allegations | None — no victim has named Barak |
| Criminal charges | None |

## European Political Connections

### [[People/Thorbjorn-Jagland]] — Former Prime Minister of Norway; Council of Europe Secretary General

Thorbjørn Jagland served as Prime Minister of Norway (1996–1997), as Secretary General of the Council of Europe (2009–2019) — the continent's principal human rights body — and as Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee during the period in which the Nobel Peace Prize was controversially awarded to Barack Obama. His connection to Epstein is listed in the Wikipedia Epstein article alongside Mandelson, Clinton, and Prince Andrew, indicating a documented relationship (Wikipedia, Epstein files article, 2026). The precise nature and content of the Jagland-Epstein relationship have not been fully established in the available public record as of vault date. No criminal allegations have been made. Research task: primary sourcing from DOJ files for Jagland-specific correspondence required.

The significance of a Council of Europe Secretary General appearing in the Epstein network is considerable — the Council of Europe is responsible for the European Convention on Human Rights and oversees the European Court of Human Rights.

---

### [[People/Mette-Marit-Crown-Princess-Norway]] — Crown Princess of Norway

Mette-Marit Tjessem Høiby, Crown Princess of Norway and wife of Crown Prince Haakon, had documented contact with Epstein that the Norwegian royal family publicly acknowledged. Norwegian royal family representatives confirmed meetings with Epstein and expressed public regret (major journalism, 2019). The DOJ file release further documented the connection, placing Mette-Marit in the Wikipedia Epstein article sidebar — a sourced summary list of documented Epstein relationships (Wikipedia, Epstein files article, 2026). No criminal allegations have been made against the Crown Princess.

The Norwegian royal family's acknowledgment places the Mette-Marit connection in a different category from purely asserted relationships — it constitutes an official admission of contact, distinguishing it from denials or non-responses.

---

### Terje Rød-Larsen — Senior UN Diplomat; Norwegian Diplomat

Terje Rød-Larsen served as UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and as a senior Norwegian diplomat. His wife, Mona Juul, served as Norway's Ambassador to Jordan and Iraq and resigned in February 2026 following the release of DOJ files naming Rød-Larsen (Al Jazeera, Feb 24, 2026; 2026-DOJ-Epstein-Files-Release.md). Rød-Larsen himself was named in the DOJ files as being under scrutiny. No criminal charges have been filed against either Rød-Larsen or Juul. The Rød-Larsen-Epstein connection is significant given Rød-Larsen's role in Middle East diplomacy during the Oslo Process, which represents another intersection between Epstein's documented network and sensitive geopolitical negotiations.

---

### Tom Pritzker — Hyatt Hotels Executive Chairman

Tom Pritzker, executive chairman of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation and member of the Pritzker family (the family behind Hyatt), was named in the 2026 DOJ files. He is under scrutiny but has not been charged (2026-DOJ-Epstein-Files-Release.md). The Pritzker family has extensive political connections in the United States, including through Penny Pritzker's service as US Secretary of Commerce. No criminal allegations have been established in the public record.

---

## Gulf and Middle East Connections

### [[People/Sultan-Ahmed-bin-Sulayem]] — Former Chairman and CEO, DP World

**Summary of documented relationship:** Bin Sulayem is the most prominently named Gulf figure in the 2026 DOJ file release. He was identified as the recipient of a specific "torture video" email from Epstein (DOJ file EFTA00666117). He was replaced as Chairman and CEO of DP World in February 2026 — the month following his identification in the released files.

#### DP World and its Significance

DP World is one of the world's largest port operators, managing operations in more than 80 countries. Bin Sulayem had led the organisation for approximately three decades. His replacement represents a significant corporate and geopolitical consequence of the Epstein file release, given DP World's role in global maritime infrastructure and UAE government-linked commerce.

#### The "Torture Video" Email — DOJ File EFTA00666117 (Documented)

Per DOJ files released January 30, 2026 (justice.gov/epstein):

- Email date: April 24, 2009
- Sender: Jeffrey Epstein
- Text: "where are you? are you ok, I loved the torture video."
- The recipient field in the publicly released version is redacted
- DOJ file reference EFTA00666117 links this email to "Sultan Bin Sulayem" in the associated records
- Congressional confirmation: Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY), who reviewed unredacted documents at the DOJ under legislative access provisions, publicly named the recipient as "a Sultan" (Newsweek, 2026)
- Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche confirmed that bin Sulayem's name appears in the unredacted file linked to that email (The New Republic, 2026)
- Snopes published a fact-check confirming the identification and correcting erroneous early social media claims that the email was addressed to Benjamin Netanyahu (Snopes, 2026)

What the "torture video" reference designates remains unknown. No criminal charges have been filed in connection with the email. Bin Sulayem has made no public statement in response to the revelations as of vault date.

#### Broader Communications (Reported)

Per CNN reporting on the released DOJ files, bin Sulayem and Epstein exchanged communications characterised as "often including explicit content" and discussed regional contacts and visits to Epstein's Caribbean property, Little Saint James (CNN Business, Feb 13, 2026). Dubai's Government Media Office announced bin Sulayem's replacement without naming him or referencing Epstein (CBS News, 2026).

## Other Figures Named in DOJ Files and Proceedings

### Jes Staley — Former Barclays CEO; Former JPMorgan Private Bank Head

Staley occupies a unique position in this network as simultaneously a political-adjacent corporate figure and a documented financial enabler of Epstein's operation. As Head of JPMorgan's Private Bank, Staley oversaw Epstein's accounts from 1998 until JPMorgan terminated the relationship in 2013 — despite internal compliance flags beginning in 2006 warning that Epstein's cash withdrawal patterns may have been related to payments to women.

Over 1,200 emails between Staley and Epstein were discovered in litigation. Staley referred to Epstein in correspondence as "the most important person in my career" and his "deepest and most cherished friend" (FCA Upper Tribunal ruling, June 26, 2025). The Financial Conduct Authority (UK) found that Staley "recklessly" misled Barclays and the FCA about the nature of his relationship with Epstein. The Upper Tribunal upheld a permanent ban from UK financial services and a £1.1 million fine (June 26, 2025 — public record). JPMorgan settled with the US Virgin Islands Attorney General for $75 million and with Epstein victim plaintiffs for $290 million (2023).

Staley's case demonstrates how Epstein's financial infrastructure intersected with the highest levels of global banking — institutions that also serviced the accounts of political clients and government funds.

### Kathy Ruemmler — Goldman Sachs; Former Obama White House Counsel

Kathy Ruemmler, who served as White House Counsel under President Barack Obama and subsequently became a senior partner and top lawyer at Goldman Sachs, was named in the 2026 DOJ Epstein files (CNBC, 2026). No wrongdoing has been established. Her dual political and corporate prominence — Obama administration official turned Goldman Sachs counsel — illustrates the network's reach across political administrations and financial institutions.

---

### Howard Lutnick — US Secretary of Commerce (2025 appointment)

Howard Lutnick, confirmed as US Secretary of Commerce in the Trump administration in 2025, was mentioned in the 2026 DOJ Epstein file release. No wrongdoing has been established; CBS News noted he was among several figures mentioned in files without evidence of misconduct (CBS News, 2026).

---

### Bill Richardson — Former Governor of New Mexico; Former US Ambassador to the UN

Bill Richardson (deceased 2023) was named in Giuffre civil depositions released in January 2024 (*Giuffre v. Maxwell*, SDNY 15-CV-07433). The allegations were denied by Richardson before his death. Richardson's New Mexico connection is relevant geographically — Epstein's Zorro Ranch operated in New Mexico, and Richardson served as Governor of that state during the relevant period. All allegations constitute civil deposition material (#claim).

---

### Elon Musk — Technology Executive

Elon Musk was named in the 2026 DOJ Epstein file release alongside Trump and Clinton. CBS News reported that none of the three have been connected to wrongdoing in the released files (CBS News, 2026). Musk's name in the files reflects the broader breadth of Epstein's contact network rather than established conduct.

---

## The NPA Political Dimension

The 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement is the most consequential single political act connected to the Epstein case. Its terms — particularly the federal immunity provision, the victim secrecy provision, and the work-release arrangement — cannot be explained solely by routine prosecutorial discretion. The documented record raises questions about what political or institutional pressures shaped the agreement.

### What the NPA Established (Documented)

The NPA (SDFL 08-80736, signed June 30, 2008) accomplished four protective outcomes:

1. **Federal immunity**: Declined all potential federal charges, regardless of evidence, confining prosecution to the weakest state-level charges
2. **Co-conspirator immunity**: Extended protection to any unnamed individual who had participated in Epstein's conduct — providing blanket protection to the entire social and operational network
3. **Secrecy from victims**: Actively concealed the agreement's existence from the women it purportedly addressed — ruled unconstitutional by Judge Marra in 2019
4. **Work release**: Enabled Epstein to leave the Palm Beach County Stockade 12 hours per day, six days per week — a privilege rarely extended to registered sex offenders

The co-conspirator immunity provision is the most politically significant element: it immunised, from federal prosecution, every individual who had participated in Epstein's trafficking operation in Florida during the relevant period. The identities of those individuals have never been fully established in the public record.

### Acosta's Role and Oversight

US Attorney Acosta signed the NPA and stated in 2019 that he had briefed Main Justice — the DOJ in Washington — and received approval (Acosta press conference, July 10, 2019). The identity of the Main Justice official(s) who reviewed and approved the deal has not been publicly established. The DOJ OPR inquiry has produced no public report. The Senate Judiciary Committee's 2019 demand for Main Justice correspondence on the NPA received what the committee characterised as an incomplete response (Senate Judiciary Committee public letters, 2019).

### The Intelligence Dimension

Acosta's statement — that he was told Epstein "belonged to intelligence" — if accurate, implies that a US intelligence community equiy was asserted in the NPA negotiations. No intelligence agency has confirmed this. Former CIA officer John Kiriakou's public professional assessment identifies Epstein as a probable Mossad access agent (Kiriakou, TMJ News Network interview, 2026; The American Conservative interview). The DOJ's own 2026 memo, released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, concluded that no confirmed intelligence affiliation for Epstein is established in the released files (DOJ memo, justice.gov/epstein; NPR, CBS News, January 2026).

### Who in DOJ Knew (Public Record — Partial)

| Person | Role | Level of Knowledge — Documented |
|---|---|---|
| A. Marie Villafaña | AUSA SDFL (lead prosecutor) | Negotiated NPA terms; direct knowledge |
| Alexander Acosta | US Attorney SDFL | Signed NPA; stated he briefed Main Justice |
| Unknown Main Justice official(s) | DOJ, Washington | Acosta stated NPA was reviewed and approved; identity not public |
| Jay Lefkowitz | Epstein lead defense counsel | Negotiated NPA terms from defense side |
| Alan Dershowitz | Consulting defense counsel | Involved in NPA negotiations (public statements, court record) |

The absence of publicly identified Main Justice decision-makers represents one of the most significant gaps in the documented political record of the Epstein case.

---

## How Political Connections Protected Epstein

The documented record supports several distinct mechanisms by which Epstein's political network provided operational protection:

### 1. Prosecutorial Deference (Documented)

The 2008 NPA is the most concrete example. Acosta's statement that he was told Epstein "belonged to intelligence" — combined with the extraordinary breadth of the NPA's immunity provisions — is consistent with the pattern of a prosecution shaped by factors external to the evidence. The NPA's co-conspirator immunity clause protected the entire political network from federal prosecution for Epstein's Florida-based conduct.

### 2. Social Legitimacy (Documented by Pattern)

Epstein's documented relationships with Clinton, Prince Andrew, Barak, and others created a social armour. Investigative journalists who attempted to report on Epstein prior to 2018 faced institutional resistance; Amy Robach of ABC News (see [[People/Amy-Robach]]) and others have described editorial decisions to suppress Epstein stories, citing the political prominence of named individuals. The BBC, for example, declined to air reporting on Epstein for years (see [[Findings/Media-Suppression]]).

### 3. Financial Network Insulation (Documented)

The JPMorgan relationship, with Jes Staley advocating to retain Epstein as a client despite compliance flags, kept Epstein's financial infrastructure intact after his 2008 conviction. JPMorgan was the banking institution of record for the US government and major political figures — the retention of Epstein's accounts within that structure lent his financial operation a degree of normalcy and access that an isolated offshore operator would not have had.

### 4. Post-Conviction Access (Documented)

The fact that Prince Andrew stayed at Epstein's townhouse in December 2010 — and that Ehud Barak met Epstein approximately 30 times between 2013 and 2017, including photographed visits to the townhouse — establishes that Epstein's registered sex offender status was not a social disqualifier among political elites. This continued access undermined the deterrent function of the 2008 conviction and demonstrated to potential witnesses and victims that Epstein remained socially protected.

### 5. Blackmail Architecture (Documented Preconditions — Operational Use Not Proven)

The FBI's recovery of hidden cameras throughout Epstein's Manhattan townhouse, the documented photographing of guests without consent, and the recovery of thousands of sexually explicit photographs create the documented structural preconditions for a blackmail operation (SDNY 19-CR-490; FBI search warrant inventory; [[Findings/Blackmail-Operation]]). The DOJ's 2026 memo concluded that no confirmed blackmail programme was established in the released files — a conclusion that has been contested by civil attorneys and investigative journalists who argue the absence of a "client list" does not preclude coercive leverage from existing in other forms.

## Flight Log Analysis — Political Network Summary

The Lolita Express (N908JE) flight logs, obtained via civil discovery subpoena and reviewed by multiple outlets, constitute the most systematic documentary evidence of Epstein's political network access. Key analytical points:

- **Bill Clinton** appears in logs 26+ times — the most documented political figure in the flight records
- **Prince Andrew** appears in logs on multiple documented occasions
- **Ghislaine Maxwell** is a near-constant presence on logged flights, indicating her role as Epstein's operational partner in political access cultivation
- **Jean-Luc Brunel** appears on multiple documented flights, indicating overlap between the modelling recruitment pipeline and the political passenger network
- **Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker** appear on an Africa trip alongside Clinton — illustrating the blending of political and celebrity access in Epstein's network
- The logs show consistent routes to **Little Saint James** (USVI), **Palm Beach** (358 El Brillo Way), **Zorro Ranch** (New Mexico), Paris, and various European and international destinations
- The aircraft was equipped with a massage table (flight attendant testimony, Maxwell trial, SDNY 20-CR-330) — confirming the plane itself was a venue for conduct, not merely a transport vehicle
- Some passenger names in the released logs remain redacted; full de-redaction has not occurred as of vault date

Epstein also operated a Gulfstream jet (N121JE) used for shorter, more private trips. The Gulfstream logs are less comprehensive in the public record and likely document additional contacts not captured in the 727 records.

## 2026 DOJ Files — Political Revelations Summary

The Epstein Files Transparency Act (enacted November 2025) resulted in the release of approximately 3 million pages beginning December 2025 and culminating in a major January 30, 2026 tranche. Material is available at justice.gov/epstein. Key political revelations from the release:

| Person / Subject | DOJ File Finding | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Prince Andrew | Email showing classified UK document forwarded to Epstein | Arrested Feb 19, 2026; released under investigation |
| Peter Mandelson | "Best pal" note; classified financial document communication; lobbying email | Sacked as ambassador Sep 2025; arrested Feb 23, 2026; released on bail |
| Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem | "Torture video" email recipient (EFTA00666117) | Replaced at DP World Feb 2026 |
| Børge Brende | Post-2008 correspondence with Epstein | Resigned WEF President Feb 26, 2026 |
| Jack Lang | Named in files | French investigation; resigned Arab World Institute Feb 2026 |
| Brad Karp | Ties revealed | Stepped down as Paul Weiss chairman Feb 2026 |
| Mona Juul / Terje Rød-Larsen | Named in files | Juul resigned as Norway ambassador Feb 2026 |
| Tom Pritzker | Named in files | Under scrutiny; not charged |
| Kathy Ruemmler | Named in files | Under scrutiny; not charged |
| Donald Trump | Withheld FBI 302 summaries | Bipartisan congressional scrutiny of withheld documents |
| Bill Clinton | Mentioned in files | No wrongdoing established |
| Elon Musk | Mentioned in files | No wrongdoing established |

The DOJ issued a warning that the released tranche "may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos" — specifically citing "untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump submitted right before the 2020 election" (DOJ statement, January 30, 2026). This warning applies specifically to unverified tip submissions and does not affect the evidentiary weight of official FBI and DOJ investigative documents within the same release.

## Analytical Note — Documented vs. Speculative

This document has adhered throughout to the vault's content policy. The following distinctions are maintained:

- **No claim is treated as established unless supported by flight logs, DOJ files, court records, or established investigative journalism**
- All sexual conduct allegations against living non-convicted persons are tagged #claim
- Intelligence connection claims are documented as stated assessments, not confirmed facts
- The blackmail theory is documented as having the structural preconditions established, without asserting operational deployment as proven
- The significance of the political network is analysed on the basis of documented patterns, not on inference from speculative accounts

The documented political network is remarkable in what the public record has established without resort to speculation: two serving US presidents flew on Epstein's aircraft; a future British king's brother was arrested in connection with documents showing transmission of classified material to a convicted sex offender; the Prime Minister of Israel met the same sex offender approximately 30 times after his conviction; and the US Attorney who declined to federally prosecute that sex offender stated he was told the offender "belonged to intelligence."

These are not claims. They are the documented record.
