- MIT Media Lab received donations via Joi Ito (Lab director resigned 2019)
- Harvard (Martin Nowak research group) received millions
- Epstein expressed interest in transhumanist ideas and "seeding the human race" with his DNA — documented in New York Times reporting (2019)
- These are documented facts about his stated interests and donations, **not evidence of a criminal eugenics program**
