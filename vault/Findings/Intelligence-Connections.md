| Claim | Epstein "belonged to intelligence" and Acosta was told to "leave it alone" |
| Acosta's position | At his July 10, 2019 press conference, Acosta did not deny the conversation but distanced himself from the characterisation; said he was uncertain what it meant |

## John Kiriakou — Former CIA Officer Assessment

**Who is Kiriakou:** Former CIA Counterterrorism Officer; first US government official to confirm waterboarding was used on detainees (2007); convicted and imprisoned for passing classified information to a reporter; widely regarded as a genuine intelligence whistleblower.

**His Assessment of Epstein:**

Kiriakou describes Epstein as a textbook "**access agent**" — his professional assessment, not a confirmed intelligence record:

> "I believe very strongly he was a spy... I'm confident it was the Israelis."

- An access agent is someone who doesn't have intelligence training but has access to high-value targets and is used to recruit or gather information from them
- Kiriakou's assessment: Epstein's role was to gain access to powerful people on behalf of Israeli intelligence (Mossad)
- This is Kiriakou's **professional opinion** based on the pattern of behaviour he observed, not documentary evidence he personally has access to
