# Epstein: AI, Transhumanism & the Eugenics Vision

> **Documented finding.** The New York Times (2019) and New York Magazine documented Epstein's stated goal of using his New Mexico ranch to impregnate 20 women at a time with his sperm in a transhumanist "seeding" operation. His AI and scientific philanthropy was tied to this ideological framework.

## The "Seeding Humanity" Project — Documented

### NYT Report (2019)
- The New York Times (August 2019, reporters James B. Stewart et al.) documented that Epstein told "several prominent scientists and businessmen" about a plan to impregnate 20 women at a time at his New Mexico ranch ([[Locations/Zorro-Ranch-New-Mexico]])
- Goal: to "seed the human race with his DNA"
- The plan combined transhumanism, eugenics, and Epstein's apparent messianic self-conception
- Multiple scientists were told this at Edge Foundation and similar events

### The "Cryonics" Plan
- Epstein also discussed having his head and penis cryogenically preserved after death
- Told to scientists at dinner parties, reportedly as a serious long-term goal
- Some attendees dismissed it; others reported it seriously

## Epstein's AI and Scientific Funding

### Edge Foundation
- Epstein funded and participated in Edge Foundation ([[People/John-Brockman]]) events
- Edge connected him to the world's leading AI researchers, cognitive scientists, and evolutionary biologists
- Steven Pinker (Harvard), Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Marvin Minsky ([[People/Marvin-Minsky]]) all in Edge network

### Harvard Program for Evolutionary Dynamics
- Epstein's largest Harvard donation went to the **Program for Evolutionary Dynamics** under Martin Nowak
- Funded evolutionary biology research — directly aligned with Epstein's stated interest in human genetic "improvement"
- Nowak was close associate; flew on Epstein's plane
- Harvard received $6.5M+ for this program specifically

### MIT Media Lab (AI Focus)
- Epstein's donations to MIT ([[People/Joi-Ito]]) funded AI and cognitive science research
- MIT Media Lab conducted cutting-edge work on machine learning, affective computing, human-machine interaction
- Epstein wanted access to and credit for AI research being done with his money

### The Zorro Ranch "Science Center"
- [[Locations/Zorro-Ranch-New-Mexico]] had a dedicated science/research facility
- Visiting scientists were hosted there
- Ranch was proposed location for the impregnation program

## Eugenics — Ideological Framework

### Self-Described Interest
- Epstein explicitly discussed interest in "improving" the human gene pool
- Told associates he believed his own DNA was superior
- Framework blended:
  - Transhumanism (technology to overcome biological limits)
  - Eugenics (directed genetic "improvement")
  - Messianic self-conception (himself as genetic benefactor of humanity)

### Scientific Cover
- Epstein used legitimate scientific funding to launder his eugenics ideology as "philanthropy"
- Scientists taken seriously by Epstein often had no idea of his criminal history or the full context of his interests
- Post-2019, many distanced themselves publicly

## AI Interests — Specific Documented Connections

| Institution/Person | Funding/Connection | AI Relevance |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| MIT Media Lab ([[People/Joi-Ito]]) | $7.5M+ | AI, cognitive science, affective computing |
| Harvard PED (Martin Nowak) | $6.5M+ | Evolutionary computation, genetic algorithms |
| [[People/Marvin-Minsky]] | Social/intellectual | Pioneer of AI; MIT AI Lab co-founder |
| Santa Fe Institute | Donations | Complexity theory, emergent systems |
| [[People/John-Brockman]] Edge | Funding/patronage | AI researchers regularly featured |

### The Surveillance Angle
- Epstein's hidden camera network (see [[Findings/Blackmail-Operation]]) reflects sophisticated technical capability
- Some analysts note that running a multi-property hidden surveillance operation requires technical infrastructure beyond simple camera installation #claim
- Whether AI-enabled facial recognition or automated analysis was used is unknown #claim
