## JPMorgan Relationship with Epstein (Documented)

Staley was Head of JPMorgan's Private Bank — the division that held Epstein's accounts from 1998 until JPMorgan terminated the relationship in 2013.

### Email Correspondence (1,200+ Emails)

Per court filings in USVI v. JPMorgan Chase (USVI AG lawsuit) and related civil litigation:

- Over **1,200 emails** between Staley and Epstein were discovered by JPMorgan during litigation
- Staley referred to Epstein in emails as **"the most important person in my career"**
- Called Epstein his **"deepest and most cherished friend"** in correspondence
- Emails described as "warm and affectionate" by regulators, inconsistent with Staley's claim to FCA that he had no close personal relationship with Epstein
- Some emails contained language regulators found difficult to interpret; Staley maintained these were not sexual in nature

### JPMorgan Internal Flags

- JPMorgan compliance staff internally flagged Epstein's account multiple times 2006–2012
- Epstein account generated concerns related to cash withdrawals (noted in court filings as potentially related to payments to women)
- Internal documents showed Staley was aware of compliance concerns and advocated to retain Epstein as a client
- JPMorgan terminated Epstein's accounts in 2013

## Barclays CEO (2015–2021)

- Appointed CEO of Barclays plc in December 2015
- Disclosed to Barclays board that he had a relationship with Epstein before his arrest; board assessed and allowed him to continue
- **Resigned November 1, 2021** after FCA announced it was investigating his characterisation of his relationship with Epstein

## FCA Investigation and Ban (Outcome: Public Record)

| Event | Date | Detail |
|-------|------|--------|
| FCA investigation announced | 2021 | Whether Staley misled Barclays board and FCA about relationship with Epstein |
| Staley resignation | November 1, 2021 | Resigned as Barclays CEO |
| FCA Initial Decision | 2023 | Proposed ban + £1.8M fine |
| Staley appeal | 2023–2025 | Appealed to Upper Tribunal |
| Upper Tribunal ruling | **June 26, 2025** | Upheld ban; reduced fine to £1.1M |
| Final status | **July 2025** | **Permanently banned from holding senior management roles in UK financial services** |

**FCA finding:** Staley "recklessly" misled Barclays and the FCA about the nature of his relationship with Epstein when asked. The Tribunal found he claimed to the FCA the relationship was professional only, which was inconsistent with the volume and character of correspondence discovered.
