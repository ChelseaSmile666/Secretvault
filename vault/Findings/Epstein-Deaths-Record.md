## Intelligence / Controversy Note

The deaths of Epstein, Brunel, and Giuffre — all key figures who could have testified — have been noted by journalists, attorneys, and congressional members. The DOJ 2026 files' video review of Epstein's cell was released specifically to address ongoing public skepticism about the official suicide ruling. The official position of all relevant authorities remains suicide in all three cases.
