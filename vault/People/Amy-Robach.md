# Amy Robach

> **Status: Active** — Former ABC News anchor. Had Epstein story ready in 2015 — three years before Miami Herald broke it — but ABC killed it. Documented in leaked tape. See [[Findings/Media-Suppression]].

## Connection

- Conducted on-camera interviews with Virginia Giuffre and corroborating witnesses (2015)
- ABC executives killed the story citing "standards" — Robach on leaked tape cited palace pressure and "Clinton" information in the story
- Epstein arrest in 2019 finally allowed story to surface; Project Veritas published leaked tape showing Robach's frustration
- Robach was not fired; her contract later ended in 2023 for unrelated reasons
- The tape is documented evidence of editorial suppression
