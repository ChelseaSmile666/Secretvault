## Epstein–Trump Documented Relationship

### The 2002 New York Magazine Quote
- Trump told New York Magazine (2002): "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his life."
- This is a documented verbatim quote and is frequently cited

### Mar-a-Lago Membership
- Epstein was a member of Mar-a-Lago
- Both men were part of the same Palm Beach elite social circuit in the 1990s–2000s
- Multiple parties and events at Mar-a-Lago documented where both were present

### The Ban
- Trump banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago approximately 2007–2008
- Trump campaign stated this was because Epstein "hit on" a young female Mar-a-Lago employee
- This account has not been independently verified but is publicly stated Trump position
- The ban is consistent with Epstein's Palm Beach investigation beginning (2005)

### Virginia Giuffre — Mar-a-Lago Meeting
- Virginia Giuffre has stated she first met Ghislaine Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago
- Giuffre was working as a locker room attendant at the club at the time
- This is documented in Giuffre's civil filings and is a key origin point of her involvement
